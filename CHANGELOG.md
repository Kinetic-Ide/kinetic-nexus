# Changelog

All notable changes to Alayra Nexus™ are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The `model: "alayra-nexus-1"` routing contract is the public API surface covered by
semver. The legacy ids `kinetic-nexus-1` and `nexus` remain accepted as aliases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Response caching (Phase 4.5):** optional exact-match response cache. When enabled,
  an identical request (same model + messages + generation params) is served from
  Redis, skipping the provider entirely — a real $0 call. The cache key excludes
  `stream`/`user`, so a hit is replayed in whichever mode the client asked for; every
  hit emits a $0 usage event attributed to the team (analytics stay honest, budget is
  not consumed). Tool-call and `n > 1` responses are not cached. Off by default;
  configurable via `CACHE_ENABLED` / `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, the dashboard Settings tab,
  or `GET/PUT /admin/settings/cache`. Responses carry `X-Nexus-Cache: hit|miss`, and a
  `nexus_response_cache_total{result}` metric tracks hit/miss/store.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Teams & budget hierarchy (Phase 5):** a `Team` entity groups scoped access keys
  and carries a per-period USD budget cap (daily / weekly / monthly). Enforcement
  runs on the admission path: over-budget teams get `429` + `Retry-After` (window
  reset), suspended teams get `403`. Spend is Redis-tracked and seeded from real
  usage history, so caps set mid-period start from actual spend and survive a Redis
  restart. New admin API: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /admin/teams` (list includes live
  period spend), team assignment on key creation, and `PATCH /admin/team-keys/:id`
  to reassign. Existing keys without a team are unaffected.
- **Observability (Phase 4.6):** a Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint —
  request rate/duration, upstream TTFB, tokens, cache-hit rate, per-provider
  request/error rates, pool utilization, and standard process metrics. Auth-guarded
  by `METRICS_TOKEN` (or `ADMIN_PASSWORD`), exempt from the abuse guard's rate limit.
  Optional OpenTelemetry span for the gateway→provider call (no-op without an SDK).
- README "Connect your tools" section with copy-paste setup for Cursor, Cline / Roo
  Code, Continue.dev, the OpenAI SDK (Python + Node), and curl.

### Fixed
- **Database migrations now actually apply.** The migration files were flat SQL that
  `prisma migrate deploy` (run by the container at startup) silently ignored — a
  fresh `docker run` database got no tables, and Compose installs missed the
  post-init migration. Migrations now use the standard Prisma layout and are applied
  in order on startup; the Compose initdb mount was removed as redundant.
  **Existing deployments** whose schema was created by the old initdb path should
  baseline once before upgrading:
  `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0001_init && npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0002_team_key_usage`
  (or use `npm run db:push`).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-09

First tagged release and first published container image
(`ghcr.io/alayra-systems-pvt-limited/alayra-nexus`).

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible proxy** (`/v1/chat/completions`) with full streaming
  pass-through and a single virtual model, `alayra-nexus-1`.
- **Real admission control** — atomic per-key RPM/TPM enforcement via a Redis Lua
  script, a real tokenizer (`js-tiktoken`) for pre-admission estimates, TPM
  reservation with post-response reconciliation, and upstream TTFT / body /
  stream-idle timeouts.
- **Circuit breaker** — per-key escalating cooldown, a single half-open recovery
  probe, separate flat handling for 429s, and auto-ban on repeated auth failures.
- **Cache-aware sticky routing** — multi-turn conversations stay pinned to the key
  that last served them so provider prompt caches are reused.
- **Cost-aware routing** (optional) — bias toward the cheapest healthy, in-headroom
  provider within a tier, as a tiebreaker that never overrides health or cache
  affinity.
- **Content guardrails** (optional) — pluggable prompt/response filtering to redact
  PII or block banned content / injection patterns.
- **SSRF protection** — outbound provider requests are restricted to http(s) and
  blocked from private/loopback/internal hosts by default, with an opt-in allowlist.
- **Async analytics pipeline** — usage events are buffered and written to Postgres
  in batched inserts off the request path.
- **Abuse guard** — a Redis-backed, per-credential rate limiter sized as a DoS
  backstop rather than a throughput cap.
- **Admin dashboard** — provider pools, model registry, team keys, analytics, and a
  Settings tab (network security, guardrails, cost-aware routing).
- **Distribution** — multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) Docker image, `docker compose`
  quickstart, CI (lint / typecheck / test / build / security audit), and CodeQL
  scanning.

### Fixed
- Container image: install OpenSSL in the Alpine build and runtime stages so Prisma
  resolves the correct `openssl-3.0.x` engine instead of mis-guessing `1.1.x`, which
  could otherwise fail the query engine at container startup.

### Security
- Apache-2.0 licensed. Outbound SSRF blocking on by default; secrets encrypted at
  rest with AES-256-GCM.

### Known gaps (roadmap)
- Constant-time comparison and 2FA for admin auth (Phase 6) are not yet in place;
  protect the admin password and API key accordingly for now.
