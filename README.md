## Why Alayra Nexus?

Most teams hit the same wall: multiple AI providers, API keys scattered across engineers, no visibility into who spent what, and a hard-coded provider string that makes switching models painful.

Alayra Nexus is the infrastructure layer that sits between your application and every AI provider. Change **one URL**. Get load balancing, automatic failover, team-level access control, and a live cost dashboard — without touching your application code.

---

## Features

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Key Pool Management** | Store unlimited API keys per provider, encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM |
| **Intelligent Load Balancing** | Automatic rotation across active keys; cooling and banned keys are automatically bypassed |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Per-key breaker with escalating cooldown, a single half-open recovery probe, separate 429 handling, and auto-ban on repeated auth failures |
| **Cache-Aware Sticky Routing** | Multi-turn conversations stay pinned to the same upstream so the provider's prompt cache isn't thrown away by round-robin |
| **Content Guardrails** | Optional, pluggable prompt/response filtering — redact PII or block banned content and injection patterns. Off by default |
| **Tiered Failover** | Premium → Standard → Fast chains; when the best key fails the next tier fires instantly |
| **Cost-Aware Routing** | Optional: within a tier, bias toward the cheapest healthy, in-headroom provider using registry pricing — a tiebreaker that never overrides health or cache affinity |
| **OpenAI-Compatible API** | Drop-in `/v1/chat/completions` — change one base URL, nothing else |
| **Anthropic-Compatible API** | `/v1/messages` too, so **Claude Code** and the Anthropic SDKs route through the same pool — streaming, tools, and all |
| **Team Key Issuance** | Create scoped access tokens per team, each with an independently configurable RPM limit |
| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | A team can register its own provider keys, encrypted at rest and routed only for that team's traffic — with optional fall-back to the shared pool, or hard isolation |
| **Real-Time Rate Limiting** | Per-key RPM enforcement via Redis with live utilization meters (per-key TPM budgets are configurable; enforcement is on the roadmap) |
| **Cost Tracking** | Per-request USD cost computed from model pricing, attributed to the requesting team |
| **Full Analytics Dashboard** | Request trends, token breakdowns, team leaderboard, provider split — powered by Chart.js |
| **Custom Date Ranges** | Analytics filterable by today / 7d / 30d / 90d or any custom from→to window |
| **CSV Export** | One-click export of all analytics data for finance or reporting |
| **Model Registry** | Manage which models are available, their tier, capabilities, and per-1M token pricing |
| **Web Admin Dashboard** | Full browser UI — no CLI required for day-to-day operations |
| **Two-Factor Admin Auth** | Optional TOTP second factor with single-use recovery codes, session tokens, per-source login lockout, and revocable API tokens for scripts |
| **Security Hardened** | Fastify Helmet, CORS, constant-time secret comparison, AES-256-GCM key encryption, zero plaintext secrets at rest |

## How it compares

[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) is the closest well-known project, so
here is an honest side-by-side. It wins on reach and ecosystem; Nexus wins on what
you get without paying, and on depth of the operator console.

| | Alayra Nexus | LiteLLM |
|---|---|---|
| **Providers** | 5 first-class + any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | **100+ built in** |
| **Admin dashboard** | Built in — analytics, teams, pools, audit, health | Built in |
| **Scoped team keys** | Yes | Yes (virtual keys) |
| **Team budgets** | Yes, with block / notify / downgrade at the cap | Yes |
| **Key pooling & failover** | Per-provider pools, tiered failover, circuit breaker | Load balancing, retries, fallbacks |
| **Audit trail** | Append-only, per-action, no delete endpoint | Logging integrations |
| **SSO** | **Included, Apache-2.0** | Commercial licence |
| **Two-factor auth** | **Included** | — |
| **CLI** | *Coming soon* | **Mature** |
| **SDK** | *Not yet* | **Python SDK** |
| **Language** | TypeScript / Node | Python (Rust core) |
| **Licence** | Apache-2.0, every feature included | Open source + commercial tier |

**Choose LiteLLM** if you need breadth of providers today, a mature CLI and SDK, or
its ecosystem of integrations.

**Choose Alayra Nexus** if you want a self-hosted gateway whose enterprise controls —
SSO, two-factor, audit trail, team budgets — are in the open-source licence rather
than behind a sales call, and a console your finance team can read without help.

<sub>Compared against LiteLLM's public documentation, July 2026. If anything here has
gone out of date, please open an issue — we would rather fix it than win on a stale fact.</sub>

## Architecture

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="Alayra Nexus request path — client to gateway (team auth, rate limiter, tiered router) to providers to telemetry" width="100%"/>

</div>

One request enters authenticated and budget-checked, the router picks a healthy key by
tier and cache affinity, the circuit breaker keeps a failing provider out of rotation, and
usage is batched to PostgreSQL while live metrics land in Redis — all behind a single
OpenAI-compatible URL.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Published image (fastest, no clone)

A multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) is published to **Docker Hub** and the **GitHub Container
Registry** from the same build, so the two are byte-identical — use whichever you prefer. If
you already have Postgres and Redis, run the gateway with one command:

```bash
docker run -d --name alayra-nexus -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/nexus" \
  -e REDIS_URL="redis://host:6379" \
  -e MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")" \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="change-me" \
  alayrasystems/nexus:latest
```

| Registry | Image |
|---|---|
| Docker Hub | `alayrasystems/nexus` |
| GHCR | `ghcr.io/alayra-systems-pvt-limited/alayra-nexus` |

Pin a version for production (e.g. `:1.3.2`) rather than `:latest`.

### Option B — Docker Compose (brings its own Postgres + Redis)

Nothing to clone and nothing to compile: Compose downloads the published image and
starts Postgres and Redis alongside it.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alayra-Systems-Pvt-Limited/Alayra-Nexus/main/docker-compose.yml

# Two secrets. Keep MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY safe — without it your stored
# provider keys can never be decrypted again.
cat > .env <<EOF
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me
NEXUS_VERSION=1.3.2
EOF

docker compose up -d
```

Dashboard is live at `http://localhost:3000`. The container applies its own database
migrations on startup, and prints your generated Nexus API key on first run —
`docker compose logs nexus` to see it. **Save it then: the key is stored as a hash, so it is shown
once and never again** (lost it? rotate for a new one from **Connect**).

Open the dashboard and it will ask you to create your owner account, using the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you
set above — see [Accounts and roles](#accounts-and-roles).

`DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` are set by Compose; you do not need to supply them.
Omit `NEXUS_VERSION` to track `latest`, but pin it in production.

<details>
<summary>Building from source instead (contributors)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alayra-Systems-Pvt-Limited/Alayra-Nexus.git
cd alayra-nexus
cp .env.example .env   # set MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY and ADMIN_PASSWORD

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

</details>

---

### Option C — Railway (managed cloud, no server to run)

The gateway builds from the repo and serves the dashboard from a single service, so a
managed deploy is three plugins and four variables:

1. **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo** → pick this repository. Railway builds the image.
2. Add the **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** plugins to the project.
3. On the gateway service → **Variables**, set (use each plugin's **private** connection URL):
   - `DATABASE_URL` = `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
   - `REDIS_URL` = `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}`
   - `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` = 64 hex chars — generate fresh, never reuse:
     `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` = a strong install secret (claims the first owner account)
4. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain** for a public `https://…up.railway.app` URL.

Railway's proxy sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`, so the dashboard's **Connect** page prints the
correct `https://` base URL with no extra config. Behind a proxy that doesn't, pin it with
[`PUBLIC_URL`](#environment-variables). The container runs its own migrations on boot; open
the domain and it greets you with the owner-account setup screen.

---

### Option D — Manual Setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alayra-Systems-Pvt-Limited/Alayra-Nexus.git
cd alayra-nexus

npm install

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Generate a secure MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY (run this once and save it):
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Postgres and Redis must be running. Don't have them locally? Start just the
# two dependencies with Compose and run the gateway from source:
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Start
npm run dev          # development — hot reload via tsx
npm run build && npm start   # production
```

Dashboard is live at `http://localhost:3000`

> [!TIP]
> **`Cannot reach Redis` / `Cannot reach PostgreSQL` on startup?** Both are hard
> dependencies — Redis holds rate-limit counters, circuit-breaker state, sticky
> routing, budgets and the response cache; Postgres holds everything else. The
> startup error names the one that's missing and the command that starts it.
>
> The dashboard is a Vite + Preact app in `web/`, built to static assets that the
> gateway serves at `/` — there is no separate web server to run. To work on the
> dashboard with hot reload, `cd web && npm run dev` (it proxies API calls to a
> gateway running on `:3000`).

---

## Connect your tools

Alayra Nexus speaks both the **OpenAI** API (`/v1/chat/completions`) and the
**Anthropic Messages** API (`/v1/messages`), so almost any tool that lets you set a
custom base URL works — including Claude Code. You only need three values:

- **Base URL:** `http://<your-host>:3000/v1`
- **API key:** a team key from the dashboard (sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, or `x-api-key: <key>`)
- **Model:** `alayra-nexus-1`

> [!NOTE]
> **Cursor** (and some other cloud tools) route requests through their own servers, so
> they cannot reach `http://localhost:3000` — they need a **publicly reachable HTTPS**
> base URL. Local tools such as Cline, Continue.dev, and Claude Code call your gateway
> directly and work against localhost. This is a Cursor constraint, not a Nexus one —
> LiteLLM has the same requirement.

### Claude Code
Claude Code speaks the Anthropic Messages API. Point it at the gateway:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://<your-host>:3000"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="<your-team-key>"
claude
```

Requests route through the same pool, failover, budgets, and analytics as everything
else. On startup Claude Code reads `GET /v1/models` to populate its model picker.

### Cursor
Settings → **Models** → enable **OpenAI API Key**, paste your team key, tick **Override OpenAI Base URL** and set it to `http://<your-host>:3000/v1`. Add a custom model named `alayra-nexus-1`.

### Cline / Roo Code (VS Code)
API Provider → **OpenAI Compatible** → Base URL `http://<your-host>:3000/v1`, API Key = your team key, Model ID `alayra-nexus-1`.

### Continue.dev
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Alayra Nexus",
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "alayra-nexus-1",
      "apiBase": "http://<your-host>:3000/v1",
      "apiKey": "<your-team-key>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### OpenAI SDK — Python
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://<your-host>:3000/v1", api_key="<your-team-key>")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="alayra-nexus-1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### OpenAI SDK — Node
```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://<your-host>:3000/v1",
  apiKey: "<your-team-key>",
});
const resp = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "alayra-nexus-1",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
});
console.log(resp.choices[0].message.content);
```

### curl
```bash
curl http://<your-host>:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-team-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"alayra-nexus-1","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

> Streaming works everywhere — add `"stream": true` (or the client's streaming flag). Running Nexus behind TLS? Use your `https://…/v1` URL instead.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string (`postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`) |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | Redis connection string (`redis://localhost:6379`) |
| `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | 64 hex characters (32 bytes) — encrypts all stored API keys |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | The gateway's deployment secret. Claims the first owner account on first run, and authorises a full reset. **Not** a day-to-day login once an owner exists — see [Accounts and roles](#accounts-and-roles). |
| `PORT` | No | HTTP port (default: `3000`) |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | No | The address the outside world reaches this gateway at — pins what the **Connect** page, quick-start snippets, and SSO `redirect_uri` print. Leave unset and the gateway infers it from the proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` headers, or the Host header. Set it (e.g. `https://gateway.example.com`) when a proxy forwards the host but not the scheme, so a TLS deployment would otherwise print `http://`. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Pino log level: `info`, `debug`, `warn` (default: `info`) |
| `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | No | Requests **per credential** per window before the abuse guard trips (default: `12000`). This is DoS/abuse protection, **not** a throughput cap — see [Rate limits, explained](#rate-limits-explained). |
| `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | No | Abuse-guard window (default: `1 minute`) |
| `NEXUS_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS` | No | Output tokens reserved against a key's TPM budget when a request omits `max_tokens` (default: `2048`; reconciled to real usage afterward) |
| `UPSTREAM_TTFT_MS` | No | Abort if a provider doesn't return response headers within this many ms (default: `20000`) |
| `UPSTREAM_BODY_MS` | No | Non-streaming: max ms to read the full response body (default: `60000`) |
| `UPSTREAM_STREAM_IDLE_MS` | No | Streaming: max ms gap between chunks before a hung stream is aborted (default: `30000`) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generate `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with:
> ```bash
> node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
> ```
> This key encrypts every provider API key stored in your database. Keep it secret. Keep a backup. Never reuse it across deployments.

---

## Rate limits, explained

Alayra Nexus has **two independent limits**, and it's important not to confuse them:

| Limit | Where | What it does | Who sets it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-key RPM / TPM** | Inside the pool, per provider key | The **real** throughput control. Enforced exactly against what each provider allows a given key (e.g. "this key: 60 RPM, 100K TPM"). This is what keeps you inside your providers' contracts. | Set per key in the dashboard |
| **Abuse guard** | At the server edge, per credential | A generous DoS/abuse backstop, **not** a throughput cap. Sized well above any single credential's legitimate rate so it never interferes with real traffic — it only trips on a runaway or malicious client. | `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` env var |

**Your gateway's real ceiling is the sum of your active keys' RPM limits** — pool more
keys and that ceiling rises. The abuse guard should always sit comfortably *above* that
number, never below it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Size `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` above the busiest **single** credential's expected rate,
> not your whole pool's. Because the guard is keyed per credential (each team key gets
> its own bucket), a fleet of team keys can collectively far exceed this number — but if
> you route most traffic through one key, give that key headroom. The default of `12000`
> per minute (200 req/s) suits most self-hosters; raise it if a single key legitimately
> drives more.

The guard is Redis-backed, so the limit stays correct even when you run multiple Nexus
replicas behind a load balancer, and it **fails open** — if Redis is briefly unreachable,
requests are allowed through rather than blocked.

---

## Resilience & routing

### Circuit breaker

Every key in the pool sits behind a per-key circuit breaker, so one failing provider
never keeps taking traffic it can't serve. The breaker state lives in Redis, so it stays
consistent across every Nexus replica.

| Failure | How the breaker reacts |
|---|---|
| **5xx / timeout / hung stream** | Counts as a strike. After **3** consecutive strikes in a 5-minute window the key trips **open** and is skipped by the router. |
| **Cooldown** | **Escalates** on each successive trip — 10s → 20s → 40s … doubling up to a 10-minute cap — so a key that keeps failing is pushed further away instead of being retried on the same fixed timer forever. |
| **Half-open recovery** | When the cooldown expires the router lets exactly **one** trial request through. Success closes the breaker and resets the streak; failure re-escalates without dumping full traffic back onto a still-dead provider. |
| **429 (rate limited)** | Handled **separately** — a flat, non-escalating cooldown. A rate limit is expected back-pressure, not an outage, so it never feeds the strike counter. |
| **401 / 403 (auth)** | A bad credential won't fix itself. **2** consecutive auth failures **ban** the key outright rather than merely cooling it. |

Any success at any point resets the streak to zero. Cooling and banned keys are reflected
live in the dashboard; the admin **unban** action clears the breaker state as well.

### Cache-aware sticky routing

Provider prompt caching only pays off when a conversation's follow-up turns hit the **same**
upstream key. Naïve round-robin (always pick the least-recently-used key) throws that cache
away on every turn. Nexus instead pins a conversation to the key that last served it:

- A session is identified by an explicit **`X-Nexus-Session`** header or the OpenAI **`user`**
  field if you send one, and otherwise by a stable fingerprint of the opening messages.
- Follow-up turns prefer that key for a short window (matching provider cache lifetimes),
  falling back to normal tier/LRU selection only for new sessions or when the pinned key is
  cooling, banned, or out of headroom.
- Sticky-routed responses carry an **`X-Nexus-Sticky: true`** header.

### Cost-aware routing (optional)

Within a tier, when several providers are healthy and in-headroom, Nexus can bias toward the
**cheaper** one using the per-token pricing already in your model registry — so "route to the
cheapest *capable, healthy, in-headroom* provider" becomes real. It is a **tiebreaker only**,
controlled by a single weight (*Settings → Cost-aware routing*, or `ROUTING_COST_WEIGHT`):

- `0` (default) — cost is ignored; provider order is unchanged.
- `1` — strict cheapest-first within a tier.
- in between — interpolates, biasing toward cheaper without ignoring your configured order.

Cost **never** overrides correctness. It is applied *after* tier priority (capability), the
circuit breaker and rate/token headroom (an ineligible cheap provider is still skipped), and
sticky cache affinity (a continuing conversation stays pinned to its cached key even if a
cheaper provider exists — a cache hit usually wins on total cost anyway). Unpriced providers
are ranked last but never dropped.

> [!NOTE]
> **Model exposure:** Nexus deliberately exposes a **single virtual model** — send
> `model: "alayra-nexus-1"` and the gateway routes across your pool by tier, health, and
> cache affinity. This keeps the client contract to one stable name; task-class dispatch to
> named virtual models (`nexus-fast`, `nexus-premium`, …) is intentionally out of scope for
> now so the routing contract stays simple for early adopters.

### Response caching (optional)

Distinct from cache-aware *routing* above (which reuses the **provider's** prompt cache),
this caches the **response itself**. When enabled, an **exact-match** request — same model,
messages, and generation params — is served straight from Redis, **skipping the provider
entirely**: a real **$0** call. Off by default; turn it on under *Settings → Response cache*
(or `CACHE_ENABLED` / `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`).

- The cache key excludes `stream` and `user`, so a streamed and a non-streamed request with
  the same content share an entry — and a hit is **replayed in whichever mode the client
  asked for** (drop-in compatible).
- Every hit still emits a **$0 usage event** attributed to the team, so your cost and
  analytics numbers stay honest (it doesn't consume budget). Responses carry
  `X-Nexus-Cache: hit` / `miss`.
- Tool-call responses and multi-choice (`n > 1`) requests are not cached. Identical requests
  return the same cached answer until the TTL expires — enable it where that's what you want
  (deterministic prompts, repeated evals, shared boilerplate).

> [!NOTE]
> Semantic caching (nearest-neighbour on prompt embeddings) is a heavier, opt-in
> extension planned on top of this exact-match layer — not enabled today.

---

## Teams & budgets

Group your scoped access keys into **teams**, and give each team a **USD budget cap**
per day, week, or month. Enforcement happens on the admission path — before a request
ever reaches a provider:

- A key that belongs to a team over its budget gets **`429`** with the current spend,
  the cap, and a `Retry-After` for when the window resets (UTC).
- A **suspended** team's keys get **`403`** immediately.
- Spend is tracked in Redis and **seeded from your real usage history**, so setting a
  cap mid-month starts from what the team has actually spent — and budgets survive a
  Redis restart.
- Keys without a team (and teams without a cap) behave exactly as before — nothing
  changes until you opt in.

> [!NOTE]
> Cost is only knowable after a response completes (streaming), so enforcement is
> check-then-spend: requests already in flight when the cap is crossed can overshoot
> it by their own cost. That's the standard trade for budget caps on a streaming
> gateway.

Manage teams from the dashboard's **Teams** tab — create and budget teams, issue and
assign scoped access keys, and read per-team usage — or drive the same operations over
the admin API (`/admin/teams`).

---

## BYOK — bring your own key

A provider key can be **owned by a team** instead of living in the shared pool. An
owned key serves only that team's traffic; nobody else can route through it. Set the
owner when you add the key (**Pools → + Key → Owner**), or pass `ownerTeamId` to
`POST /admin/providers/:providerId/keys`.

Routing then works in two passes:

1. **The team's own keys first**, in the usual tier order with LRU within a tier.
2. **The shared pool**, but only if the team allows it.

Per-team, `byokFallback` decides what happens when a team's own keys are all
rate-limited, cooling, or banned:

| `byokFallback` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `true` *(default)* | Fall back to the shared pool. Responses carry `X-Nexus-BYOK: true` only when an owned key served them |
| `false` | **Hard isolation.** The request gets `503` + `Retry-After`. It never touches a credential the team did not bring |

A BYOK key is **not a parallel proxy** — it is a scoped pool. Owned keys flow through
the exact same admission control, circuit breaker, guardrails, SSRF checks, and
analytics pipeline as pooled keys. There is one request path.

Two guarantees worth stating explicitly:

- **A caller with no team can never be routed through an owned key**, even when the
  shared pool is completely exhausted.
- **The response cache is partitioned by owner.** A response produced by one team's
  private key is never replayed to another team or to the shared pool, so an isolated
  team only ever sees responses its own keys paid for.

BYOK spend is still costed, attributed, and **counted against the team's budget cap** —
set `budgetUsd: null` for a team that funds its own keys and shouldn't be capped.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a team **deletes its owned provider keys** along with it. This is
> deliberate: releasing a private credential into the shared pool would let every
> other caller route through it. The team's *access* keys survive, losing only their
> budget cap.

Watch adoption with the `nexus_byok_requests_total{result}` metric — a sustained
`fallback` rate means a team is under-provisioned on its own credentials.

## API Reference

### Proxy Endpoints

```
POST /v1/chat/completions   OpenAI Chat Completions (streaming + non-streaming)
POST /v1/messages           Anthropic Messages (streaming + non-streaming)
POST /v1/embeddings         OpenAI Embeddings — for RAG / vector search
POST /v1/completions        OpenAI legacy completions — fill-in-the-middle / autocomplete
POST /v1/images/generations OpenAI Images — billed per image, not per token
POST /v1/audio/speech       OpenAI TTS — returns audio, billed per character
POST /v1/audio/transcriptions  OpenAI STT — multipart upload, billed per file
GET  /v1/models             Model discovery (OpenAI + Anthropic shape)
```

Every proxy endpoint runs through the same model-first routing, failover, circuit
breaker, budgets, and analytics — the non-chat endpoints are a thin transport over the
same core, not a separate path. Each selects a model by **capability**: `/v1/embeddings`
needs a model with the `embedding` capability, `/v1/completions` one with `completion`,
and so on. If none is configured the endpoint answers `503` naming the missing
capability rather than failing obscurely. Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer
<key>` or, for Anthropic clients, `x-api-key: <key>`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-team-key>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "alayra-nexus-1",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

`alayra-nexus-1` routes to your highest-priority active pool. You can also specify an exact model string (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `gpt-4o`, etc.) to target a specific provider directly.

**Streaming** (`"stream": true`) is fully supported — server-sent events pass through from the upstream provider with no buffering.

### Admin Routes

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/admin/nexus/summary` | Provider pool overview (active / cooling / banned counts) |
| `GET` | `/admin/providers` | Full list of provider pools |
| `POST` | `/admin/providers` | Create a provider pool |
| `POST` | `/admin/providers/:providerId/keys` | Add an API key to a pool (`ownerTeamId` makes it private to a team — BYOK) |
| `POST` | `/admin/keys/:id/test` | Test a key and check latency |
| `POST` | `/admin/keys/:id/ban` | Ban a key from rotation |
| `GET` | `/admin/keys/:id/metrics` | Live RPM and status for a key |
| `GET` | `/admin/models` | List model registry |
| `PUT` | `/admin/models` | Add or update a model in the registry |
| `GET` | `/admin/teams` | List teams with key counts and current-period spend |
| `POST` | `/admin/teams` | Create a team (name, budget cap + period, status) |
| `PATCH` | `/admin/teams/:id` | Update a team (budget, status, tier, `byokFallback`) |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/teams/:id` | Delete a team (access keys survive unassigned; **owned provider keys are deleted**) |
| `GET` | `/admin/team-keys` | List team keys |
| `POST` | `/admin/team-keys` | Issue a new team key (optionally assigned to a team) |
| `PATCH` | `/admin/team-keys/:id` | Assign or unassign a key's team |
| `GET` | `/admin/usage` | Usage totals for a period |
| `GET` | `/admin/usage/by-team-key` | Usage breakdown by team key |
| `GET` | `/admin/analytics/timeseries/teams` | Daily time series by team |
| `GET` | `/admin/analytics/timeseries/models` | Daily time series by model |

All admin routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — a session token from `POST /admin/login`,
or an admin API token for scripts and CI. On a gateway that has not been claimed yet, the raw
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` is still accepted, exactly as it was before Phase 7.13a; creating an owner account
closes that door. See [Accounts and roles](#accounts-and-roles).

## Dashboard

The built-in web dashboard (served at `/`, a Vite + Preact app) gives you full operational
control — no CLI required for day-to-day work:

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/health.png" alt="Alayra Nexus Health dashboard — gateway process, Redis and PostgreSQL vitals, and readiness checks" width="100%"/>

<sub><i>The <b>Health</b> tab — the gateway's own vitals: process, Redis, and PostgreSQL latency, cache-hit rates, and the readiness checks your load balancer sees.</i></sub>

</div>


- **Overview** — live gateway telemetry: request/token/cost trends, active keys and models, top teams, and recent admin activity by name
- **Nexus** — provider pools and the model registry: per-key RPM utilization meters, add/test/ban keys, and each model's tier, capability flags, context window, and per-1M token pricing
- **Connect** — the base URL (verified against your browser's own address bar), the API-key hint with one-click rotation, endpoint reference, and filled-in quick-start snippets
- **Analytics** — request and token trend charts, stacked model breakdown, cost area chart, input/output comparison, team leaderboard, response-cache savings, CSV export, and a custom date-range picker
- **Teams** — teams with budgets and routing tier, scoped access keys, and per-team usage stats
- **Enterprise** — operator branding / white-labelling and per-company controls
- **Security** — your sign-in security (password, TOTP two-factor with QR enrolment, active sessions) and admin API tokens
- **Caching** — the optional exact-match response cache: toggle, TTL, and live hit-rate
- **Health** — the gateway's own vitals: process, Redis, and PostgreSQL latency and readiness checks
- **Logs** — the read-only audit trail: every state-changing action, who did it, and the result
- **Settings** — system configuration: routing weights, guardrails, network/SSRF policy, notifications, and compliance/retention
- **Admin** — people and roles (owner / admin / viewer), invites, single sign-on, and the factory reset

---

## Observability

A Prometheus-compatible **`/metrics`** endpoint exposes the gateway's operational
shape, so it drops straight into an existing ops stack.

- **Metrics:** request rate and duration (by outcome and tier), upstream time-to-first-byte,
  input/output tokens, prompt-cache (sticky) hit rate, per-provider request and error
  rates (rate-limit / auth / server / timeout), pool utilization (active / cooling /
  banned keys), plus standard Node process metrics (CPU, memory, event-loop lag, GC).
- **Auth:** `/metrics` is **not** world-readable like `/health`. Scrape it with a bearer
  token — set a dedicated **`METRICS_TOKEN`** (recommended), or it falls back to
  `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. It is exempt from the abuse guard's rate limit but never from auth.

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: alayra-nexus
    authorization:
      credentials: <your METRICS_TOKEN>
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-host:3000']
```

### Distributed tracing (optional)

The gateway → provider call is wrapped in an OpenTelemetry span. It's a **no-op by
default** (zero overhead); to collect traces, run the app with a standard OTel SDK and
point it at your collector — nothing to change in the code:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://your-collector:4318 \
node --require @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register dist/server.js
```

---

## Security Model

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Key encryption** | AES-256-GCM with a per-deployment `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; plaintext keys never touch the database |
| **Admin authentication** | Per-person accounts; email and password exchanged at `/admin/login` for a short-lived session token; optional per-user TOTP second factor; per-source lockout after repeated failures (see below) |
| **Password hashing** | scrypt (memory-hard), per-user salt, cost parameters stored with the digest. The only human-chosen secret the gateway stores |
| **Constant-time secrets** | The admin password and the metrics token are compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` over fixed-width digests, so rejection latency reveals nothing about the secret |
| **Nexus API key hashing** | SHA-256; shown once when generated or rotated, never stored in the clear and never displayable again |
| **Team key hashing** | SHA-256; plaintext shown once at creation, never stored |
| **Audit attribution** | Every state-changing admin action records the account that performed it, by name — copied onto the record, so it outlives the account |
| **HTTP hardening** | Fastify Helmet — `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, HSTS, CSP headers |
| **CORS** | Configurable origin allowlist |
| **SSRF protection** | Outbound provider requests are restricted to http(s) **and** blocked from private/loopback/internal hosts by default (see below) |
| **No telemetry** | Zero outbound calls to Alayra Systems or any third party. All data stays in your infrastructure |

### Accounts and roles

The gateway has **accounts**. Everyone who administers it signs in as themselves, with their own
email, password and second factor — so the audit trail records **who** did each thing, and one person
can be removed without disturbing anyone else.

**First run.** A fresh gateway has no accounts, so the dashboard opens on a setup screen. It asks for
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your server's environment: that is the proof you are the person who installed
this gateway rather than the first stranger to find the port. You create the owner account, and are
handed a **recovery key** — shown once, and the way back if you forget your password.

After that, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is **refused as a sign-in**. It keeps two jobs: claiming a fresh
gateway, and authorising a full reset. Everything else goes through an account.

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading changes nothing until you choose.** On a gateway that has not been claimed, sign-in
> behaves exactly as it did before: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and the second factor if you enrolled one. When
> you claim, your existing authenticator and unused recovery codes **carry over** to your new account
> — nothing to set up again.

**Three roles.**

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Everything, including managing people, single sign-on, compliance/retention, the master API key, and resetting the gateway. |
| **Admin** | Run the gateway day to day: provider pools, keys, models, teams, caching, routing, guardrails. Cannot manage people or edit the controls that constrain admins (SSRF policy, arbitrary settings). |
| **Viewer** | Read-only. Every mutation is refused. |

**Invites** are links, not emails: an owner creates one and hands it over however they like (email
delivery is optional in this gateway, so an email-only invite would be a flow that silently never
works for most deployments). Each works once, expires after 7 days, and the invitee chooses their own
password — the owner never learns it.

**Removing someone** revokes the admin API tokens they created and kills their sessions on the next
request. What they did stays in the audit trail under their name: a record of who did what has to
outlive the account.

**Single sign-on** provisions an account from the `email` claim on first sign-in. The claim's role
applies only to a *new* account — for one that already exists, what an owner set in the Users tab
wins, so an identity provider's groups cannot silently re-promote someone.

**Locked out?** Your **recovery key** resets a forgotten password. Your **recovery codes** stand in
for a lost authenticator. Lose both, and the documented way back is a full reset of the gateway,
which erases everything in it.

### Admin authentication

Signing in `POST`s your email and password (and, once enrolled, an authenticator code) to
`/admin/login` and receives a **session token**. The dashboard stores only that token;
your password is never written to browser storage.

Passwords are stored with **scrypt** — memory-hard, per-user salt, cost parameters kept with the
digest so they can be raised later without invalidating anyone. It is the only human-chosen secret
the gateway stores; every other credential here is a high-entropy value the gateway generates and
keeps only as a hash.

**Two-factor authentication (TOTP)** is optional, off by default, and **each person's own** — it used
to be a single secret for the whole gateway, shared by everyone who knew the password. Enable it from
**Security → Sign-in**, or via the API:

```bash
# 1. Enrol — returns a secret and an otpauth:// URI for your authenticator app
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/admin/auth/totp/enrol

# 2. Confirm with a code from the app — returns 10 single-use recovery codes
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"code":"123456"}' http://localhost:3000/admin/auth/totp/confirm
```

Enrolment does not take effect until a code confirms it, so an abandoned enrolment
can never lock you out. Recovery codes are shown once and stored only as hashes; any
one of them may be used in place of an authenticator code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`ADMIN_PASSWORD` stops working as a bearer token on `/admin/*`** once you claim the gateway, or
> once 2FA is enabled — whichever comes first. Both have to close that door: a password that still
> authenticated API calls would bypass the second factor entirely, and would put the audit trail back
> to saying "password" instead of a name. Use a session token, or an **admin API token** for scripts
> and CI:
>
> ```bash
> curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   -d '{"name":"ci"}' http://localhost:3000/admin/tokens
> ```
>
> Admin API tokens are hashed, listed, and revocable, and are not subject to the
> second factor — treat them as the credential they are. Before 2FA is enabled, the
> password keeps working as a bearer token exactly as before, so upgrading changes
> nothing.

**Lockout.** After `ADMIN_MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` (default 5) failed sign-ins, the source
address is locked out for `ADMIN_LOCKOUT_SECONDS` (default 900) and receives `429`
with `Retry-After` — including for a correct password. A wrong password and a wrong
authenticator code are indistinguishable in the response, so the login form cannot be
used as a password oracle. `nexus_admin_login_total{result}` tracks
success / invalid / totp_required / locked_out.

### SSRF protection

Because the gateway makes outbound calls to operator-configured provider base URLs, an
unrestricted URL could be pointed at internal-only addresses — cloud metadata
(`169.254.169.254`), loopback admin panels, or private LAN hosts — turning Nexus into a
proxy into your own network. To prevent that, **Nexus blocks private, loopback, and
link-local hosts by default** on every path that adds or uses a provider URL. A blocked
URL is rejected when you save the provider, so it never reaches the request path.

Running a **local model** (Ollama, LM Studio, a private gateway)? Allow just that host:

- **In the dashboard:** *Settings → Network security* — tick "Allow private / localhost"
  to disable blocking on a trusted network, or add specific hosts (e.g. `localhost:11434`)
  to the allowlist.
- **Via environment** (baseline the dashboard builds on):
  ```bash
  # allow a specific local provider without disabling blocking:
  SSRF_ALLOWLIST=localhost:11434,127.0.0.1:11434
  # or, on a fully trusted network, disable private-host blocking entirely:
  SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true
  ```

Allowlist entries are `host` or `host:port` (a bare host permits any port). The env values
form a read-only baseline; hosts added in the dashboard are merged on top.

### Content guardrails (optional)

Guardrails are an **opt-in** content filter for prompts and responses — redact PII, or
block banned content and prompt-injection patterns. They are **off by default**; a fresh
deployment filters nothing until you enable them under *Settings → Content guardrails* (or
via `GUARDRAILS_*` env vars). Nexus hard-codes no policy — you bring the rules:

```jsonc
// each rule: name, pattern (regex), action (block|redact),
// appliesTo (input|output|both, default both), optional replacement
[
  { "name": "email", "pattern": "[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\.[a-z]{2,}", "action": "redact", "replacement": "[REDACTED_EMAIL]" },
  { "name": "injection", "pattern": "ignore (?:all |the )?previous instructions", "action": "block", "appliesTo": "input" }
]
```

Named presets you can copy as starting points: `email`, `us-phone`, `credit-card`, `ssn`,
`api-key`, `prompt-injection`.

- **Input filtering** runs on the admission path *before* the request is forwarded — a
  `block` rule returns `400`, a `redact` rule masks the match and forwards the cleaned prompt.
- **Output filtering** applies to **non-streaming** responses (block ⇒ the content is
  withheld, redact ⇒ matches masked).
- **Streaming + output rules:** the streaming path is intentionally zero-buffer for
  latency, so a response can't be inspected mid-stream. By default streamed responses are
  **input-filtered only** and carry an explicit `X-Nexus-Guardrails-Output: skipped-streaming`
  header — never silently unfiltered. Enable **buffered-safe mode** to collect the response,
  filter it, and replay it as a single chunk, trading the streaming latency win for inspection.

> [!WARNING]
> Your `.env` file contains `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.  
> Never commit it. This repository's `.gitignore` excludes `.env` by default.
