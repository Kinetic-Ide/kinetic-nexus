## Why Alayra Nexus?

Most teams hit the same wall: multiple AI providers, API keys scattered across engineers, no visibility into who spent what, and a hard-coded provider string that makes switching models painful.

Alayra Nexus is the infrastructure layer that sits between your application and every AI provider. Change **one URL**. Get load balancing, automatic failover, team-level access control, and a live cost dashboard — without touching your application code.

---

## Features

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Key Pool Management** | Store unlimited API keys per provider, encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM |
| **Intelligent Load Balancing** | Automatic rotation across active keys; cooling and banned keys are automatically bypassed |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Per-key breaker with escalating cooldown, a single half-open recovery probe, separate 429 handling, and auto-ban on repeated auth failures |
| **Cache-Aware Sticky Routing** | Multi-turn conversations stay pinned to the same upstream so the provider's prompt cache isn't thrown away by round-robin |
| **Content Guardrails** | Optional, pluggable prompt/response filtering — redact PII or block banned content and injection patterns. Off by default |
| **Tiered Failover** | Premium → Standard → Fast chains; when the best key fails the next tier fires instantly |
| **Cost-Aware Routing** | Optional: within a tier, bias toward the cheapest healthy, in-headroom provider using registry pricing — a tiebreaker that never overrides health or cache affinity |
| **OpenAI-Compatible API** | Drop-in `/v1/chat/completions` — change one base URL, nothing else |
| **Team Key Issuance** | Create scoped access tokens per team, each with an independently configurable RPM limit |
| **Real-Time Rate Limiting** | Per-key RPM enforcement via Redis with live utilization meters (per-key TPM budgets are configurable; enforcement is on the roadmap) |
| **Cost Tracking** | Per-request USD cost computed from model pricing, attributed to the requesting team |
| **Full Analytics Dashboard** | Request trends, token breakdowns, team leaderboard, provider split — powered by Chart.js |
| **Custom Date Ranges** | Analytics filterable by today / 7d / 30d / 90d or any custom from→to window |
| **CSV Export** | One-click export of all analytics data for finance or reporting |
| **Model Registry** | Manage which models are available, their tier, capabilities, and per-1M token pricing |
| **Web Admin Dashboard** | Full browser UI — no CLI required for day-to-day operations |
| **Security Hardened** | Fastify Helmet, CORS, bcrypt admin auth, AES-256-GCM key encryption, zero plaintext secrets at rest |

---

## Quick Start

### Option A — Published image (fastest, no clone)

A multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) is published to the GitHub Container Registry. If
you already have Postgres and Redis, run the gateway with one command:

```bash
docker run -d --name alayra-nexus -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/nexus" \
  -e REDIS_URL="redis://host:6379" \
  -e MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")" \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="change-me" \
  ghcr.io/kinetic-ide/alayra-nexus:latest
```

Pin a version for production (e.g. `:1.0.0`) rather than `:latest`.

### Option B — Docker Compose (brings its own Postgres + Redis)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kinetic-Ide/alayra-nexus.git
cd alayra-nexus

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY, ADMIN_PASSWORD, and DB/Redis URLs

docker compose up -d
```

Dashboard is live at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

---

### Option C — Manual Setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kinetic-Ide/alayra-nexus.git
cd alayra-nexus

npm install

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Generate a secure MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY (run this once and save it):
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Start
npm run dev          # development — hot reload via tsx
npm run build && npm start   # production
```

Dashboard is live at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string (`postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`) |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | Redis connection string (`redis://localhost:6379`) |
| `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | 64 hex characters (32 bytes) — encrypts all stored API keys |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | Dashboard admin password |
| `PORT` | No | HTTP port (default: `3000`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Pino log level: `info`, `debug`, `warn` (default: `info`) |
| `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | No | Requests **per credential** per window before the abuse guard trips (default: `12000`). This is DoS/abuse protection, **not** a throughput cap — see [Rate limits, explained](#rate-limits-explained). |
| `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | No | Abuse-guard window (default: `1 minute`) |
| `NEXUS_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS` | No | Output tokens reserved against a key's TPM budget when a request omits `max_tokens` (default: `2048`; reconciled to real usage afterward) |
| `UPSTREAM_TTFT_MS` | No | Abort if a provider doesn't return response headers within this many ms (default: `20000`) |
| `UPSTREAM_BODY_MS` | No | Non-streaming: max ms to read the full response body (default: `60000`) |
| `UPSTREAM_STREAM_IDLE_MS` | No | Streaming: max ms gap between chunks before a hung stream is aborted (default: `30000`) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generate `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with:
> ```bash
> node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
> ```
> This key encrypts every provider API key stored in your database. Keep it secret. Keep a backup. Never reuse it across deployments.

## Rate limits, explained

Alayra Nexus has **two independent limits**, and it's important not to confuse them:

| Limit | Where | What it does | Who sets it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-key RPM / TPM** | Inside the pool, per provider key | The **real** throughput control. Enforced exactly against what each provider allows a given key (e.g. "this key: 60 RPM, 100K TPM"). This is what keeps you inside your providers' contracts. | Set per key in the dashboard |
| **Abuse guard** | At the server edge, per credential | A generous DoS/abuse backstop, **not** a throughput cap. Sized well above any single credential's legitimate rate so it never interferes with real traffic — it only trips on a runaway or malicious client. | `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` env var |

**Your gateway's real ceiling is the sum of your active keys' RPM limits** — pool more
keys and that ceiling rises. The abuse guard should always sit comfortably *above* that
number, never below it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Size `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` above the busiest **single** credential's expected rate,
> not your whole pool's. Because the guard is keyed per credential (each team key gets
> its own bucket), a fleet of team keys can collectively far exceed this number — but if
> you route most traffic through one key, give that key headroom. The default of `12000`
> per minute (200 req/s) suits most self-hosters; raise it if a single key legitimately
> drives more.

The guard is Redis-backed, so the limit stays correct even when you run multiple Nexus
replicas behind a load balancer, and it **fails open** — if Redis is briefly unreachable,
requests are allowed through rather than blocked.

---

## Resilience & routing

### Circuit breaker

Every key in the pool sits behind a per-key circuit breaker, so one failing provider
never keeps taking traffic it can't serve. The breaker state lives in Redis, so it stays
consistent across every Nexus replica.

| Failure | How the breaker reacts |
|---|---|
| **5xx / timeout / hung stream** | Counts as a strike. After **3** consecutive strikes in a 5-minute window the key trips **open** and is skipped by the router. |
| **Cooldown** | **Escalates** on each successive trip — 10s → 20s → 40s … doubling up to a 10-minute cap — so a key that keeps failing is pushed further away instead of being retried on the same fixed timer forever. |
| **Half-open recovery** | When the cooldown expires the router lets exactly **one** trial request through. Success closes the breaker and resets the streak; failure re-escalates without dumping full traffic back onto a still-dead provider. |
| **429 (rate limited)** | Handled **separately** — a flat, non-escalating cooldown. A rate limit is expected back-pressure, not an outage, so it never feeds the strike counter. |
| **401 / 403 (auth)** | A bad credential won't fix itself. **2** consecutive auth failures **ban** the key outright rather than merely cooling it. |

Any success at any point resets the streak to zero. Cooling and banned keys are reflected
live in the dashboard; the admin **unban** action clears the breaker state as well.

### Cache-aware sticky routing

Provider prompt caching only pays off when a conversation's follow-up turns hit the **same**
upstream key. Naïve round-robin (always pick the least-recently-used key) throws that cache
away on every turn. Nexus instead pins a conversation to the key that last served it:

- A session is identified by an explicit **`X-Nexus-Session`** header or the OpenAI **`user`**
  field if you send one, and otherwise by a stable fingerprint of the opening messages.
- Follow-up turns prefer that key for a short window (matching provider cache lifetimes),
  falling back to normal tier/LRU selection only for new sessions or when the pinned key is
  cooling, banned, or out of headroom.
- Sticky-routed responses carry an **`X-Nexus-Sticky: true`** header.

### Cost-aware routing (optional)

Within a tier, when several providers are healthy and in-headroom, Nexus can bias toward the
**cheaper** one using the per-token pricing already in your model registry — so "route to the
cheapest *capable, healthy, in-headroom* provider" becomes real. It is a **tiebreaker only**,
controlled by a single weight (*Settings → Cost-aware routing*, or `ROUTING_COST_WEIGHT`):

- `0` (default) — cost is ignored; provider order is unchanged.
- `1` — strict cheapest-first within a tier.
- in between — interpolates, biasing toward cheaper without ignoring your configured order.

Cost **never** overrides correctness. It is applied *after* tier priority (capability), the
circuit breaker and rate/token headroom (an ineligible cheap provider is still skipped), and
sticky cache affinity (a continuing conversation stays pinned to its cached key even if a
cheaper provider exists — a cache hit usually wins on total cost anyway). Unpriced providers
are ranked last but never dropped.

> [!NOTE]
> **Model exposure:** Nexus deliberately exposes a **single virtual model** — send
> `model: "alayra-nexus-1"` and the gateway routes across your pool by tier, health, and
> cache affinity. This keeps the client contract to one stable name; task-class dispatch to
> named virtual models (`nexus-fast`, `nexus-premium`, …) is intentionally out of scope for
> now so the routing contract stays simple for early adopters.

## API Reference

### Proxy Endpoint

```
POST /v1/chat/completions
```

Fully OpenAI-compatible. Send any model string registered in your model registry.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-team-key>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "alayra-nexus-1",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

`alayra-nexus-1` routes to your highest-priority active pool. You can also specify an exact model string (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `gpt-4o`, etc.) to target a specific provider directly.

**Streaming** (`"stream": true`) is fully supported — server-sent events pass through from the upstream provider with no buffering.

### Admin Routes

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/admin/nexus/summary` | Provider pool overview (active / cooling / banned counts) |
| `GET` | `/admin/providers` | Full list of provider pools |
| `POST` | `/admin/providers` | Create a provider pool |
| `POST` | `/admin/providers/:providerId/keys` | Add an API key to a pool |
| `POST` | `/admin/keys/:id/test` | Test a key and check latency |
| `POST` | `/admin/keys/:id/ban` | Ban a key from rotation |
| `GET` | `/admin/keys/:id/metrics` | Live RPM and status for a key |
| `GET` | `/admin/models` | List model registry |
| `PUT` | `/admin/models` | Add or update a model in the registry |
| `GET` | `/admin/team-keys` | List team keys |
| `POST` | `/admin/team-keys` | Issue a new team key |
| `GET` | `/admin/usage` | Usage totals for a period |
| `GET` | `/admin/usage/by-team-key` | Usage breakdown by team key |
| `GET` | `/admin/analytics/timeseries/teams` | Daily time series by team |
| `GET` | `/admin/analytics/timeseries/models` | Daily time series by model |

All admin routes require `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_PASSWORD>`.

---

## Dashboard

The built-in web dashboard (`/dashboard`) gives you full operational control:

- **Connect** — server status, endpoint URL, one-click team key generator
- **Nexus** — provider pool overview with per-key RPM utilization meters; add, test, and ban keys without touching the CLI
- **Models** — model registry with tier assignment, capability flags (Primary / Fallback / Vision / FIM / Tools), context window, and per-1M token pricing
- **Team Keys** — issue scoped access tokens with configurable rate limits; view attribution in analytics
- **Analytics** — request and token trend charts, stacked model breakdown, cost area chart, input/output comparison, team leaderboard with medals, CSV export, and custom date range picker
- **Settings** — admin password management and system configuration

---

## Security Model

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Key encryption** | AES-256-GCM with a per-deployment `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; plaintext keys never touch the database |
| **Admin authentication** | bcrypt-hashed admin password on every protected route |
| **Team key hashing** | SHA-256; plaintext shown once at creation, never stored |
| **HTTP hardening** | Fastify Helmet — `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, HSTS, CSP headers |
| **CORS** | Configurable origin allowlist |
| **SSRF protection** | Outbound provider requests are restricted to http(s) **and** blocked from private/loopback/internal hosts by default (see below) |
| **No telemetry** | Zero outbound calls to Alayra Systems or any third party. All data stays in your infrastructure |

### SSRF protection

Because the gateway makes outbound calls to operator-configured provider base URLs, an
unrestricted URL could be pointed at internal-only addresses — cloud metadata
(`169.254.169.254`), loopback admin panels, or private LAN hosts — turning Nexus into a
proxy into your own network. To prevent that, **Nexus blocks private, loopback, and
link-local hosts by default** on every path that adds or uses a provider URL. A blocked
URL is rejected when you save the provider, so it never reaches the request path.

Running a **local model** (Ollama, LM Studio, a private gateway)? Allow just that host:

- **In the dashboard:** *Settings → Network security* — tick "Allow private / localhost"
  to disable blocking on a trusted network, or add specific hosts (e.g. `localhost:11434`)
  to the allowlist.
- **Via environment** (baseline the dashboard builds on):
  ```bash
  # allow a specific local provider without disabling blocking:
  SSRF_ALLOWLIST=localhost:11434,127.0.0.1:11434
  # or, on a fully trusted network, disable private-host blocking entirely:
  SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true
  ```

Allowlist entries are `host` or `host:port` (a bare host permits any port). The env values
form a read-only baseline; hosts added in the dashboard are merged on top.

### Content guardrails (optional)

Guardrails are an **opt-in** content filter for prompts and responses — redact PII, or
block banned content and prompt-injection patterns. They are **off by default**; a fresh
deployment filters nothing until you enable them under *Settings → Content guardrails* (or
via `GUARDRAILS_*` env vars). Nexus hard-codes no policy — you bring the rules:

```jsonc
// each rule: name, pattern (regex), action (block|redact),
// appliesTo (input|output|both, default both), optional replacement
[
  { "name": "email", "pattern": "[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\.[a-z]{2,}", "action": "redact", "replacement": "[REDACTED_EMAIL]" },
  { "name": "injection", "pattern": "ignore (?:all |the )?previous instructions", "action": "block", "appliesTo": "input" }
]
```

Named presets you can copy as starting points: `email`, `us-phone`, `credit-card`, `ssn`,
`api-key`, `prompt-injection`.

- **Input filtering** runs on the admission path *before* the request is forwarded — a
  `block` rule returns `400`, a `redact` rule masks the match and forwards the cleaned prompt.
- **Output filtering** applies to **non-streaming** responses (block ⇒ the content is
  withheld, redact ⇒ matches masked).
- **Streaming + output rules:** the streaming path is intentionally zero-buffer for
  latency, so a response can't be inspected mid-stream. By default streamed responses are
  **input-filtered only** and carry an explicit `X-Nexus-Guardrails-Output: skipped-streaming`
  header — never silently unfiltered. Enable **buffered-safe mode** to collect the response,
  filter it, and replay it as a single chunk, trading the streaming latency win for inspection.

> [!WARNING]
> Your `.env` file contains `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.  
> Never commit it. This repository's `.gitignore` excludes `.env` by default.
