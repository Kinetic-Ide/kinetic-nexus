**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 6.3 — Embeddings and Legacy Completions  

**Summary:**  
With the Anthropic dialect in place, the gateway still answered only conversational
requests. A great deal of real work is not a conversation: a retrieval system turns
documents into vectors through an embeddings endpoint, and an editor's autocomplete
fills in the middle of a line through the older completions endpoint. Neither has
messages, neither is a chat, and so neither could pass through the chat handler, which
is built around messages from end to end. This phase adds both endpoints, and it does
so without standing up a second gateway beside the first.

The distinction that made this clean is between routing and transport. Routing — which
model, which key, which provider, whether the breaker allows it, whether the team is
within budget, whether a private key must be preferred, and how the result is
accounted — is the hard, careful part, and it is already shared. Transport is merely the
shape of the request and reply on the wire, and a non-conversational request has a
simpler shape than a chat one: a body in, a body out, no streaming, no output to
inspect. So the new endpoints keep the entire routing and resilience path unchanged and
add only a lean transport around it. A request selects a model by the capability the
endpoint needs, is forwarded to the provider with the model the gateway chose in place
of whatever the client named, and the response's token counts are recorded against that
real model exactly as chat does. Every failure mode is handled the same way it is for
chat: a rate limit cools the key, a server error strikes the breaker, an authentication
failure moves toward banning it, and a timeout refunds the reserved capacity.

Because selection is now by capability, an endpoint that has no model to serve it does
not fail obscurely. A request for embeddings when no embedding-capable model is
configured returns a plain refusal that names the missing capability and points at the
Models tab, rather than a generic rate-limit message that would send an operator
looking in the wrong place. The endpoint always exists; whether it can be served is a
matter of configuration, and the response says so.

Both of these modalities are measured in tokens, which is what the usage pipeline
already records, so they needed no change to how spend is tracked. The remaining
modalities do not fit that shape — an image is billed per image, synthesized speech per
character, a transcription per second of audio — and honest accounting for them needs a
unit alongside the count. That is a schema change, and rather than fold it into this
phase it is deliberately held for the next, where images and audio are added together
with the accounting they actually require. Keeping this phase to the two token-shaped
endpoints kept it free of a migration and fully covered by tests: the reserve
estimates, the usage extraction, and the whole forward-and-report path driven through
stubbed routing to confirm success records usage and each upstream failure feeds the
breaker.

**Title:** Phase 6.2 — The Anthropic Messages API  

**Summary:**  
The gateway spoke one protocol, OpenAI's, and that single fact was why an entire class
of tools could not use it. Claude Code, and every application built on Anthropic's own
SDK, address a different endpoint with a differently shaped request, a differently
shaped reply, and a wholly different streaming format. No base URL or key could bridge
that; the endpoint simply did not exist. It exists now. Alayra Nexus answers Anthropic's
Messages API at the same origin it answers OpenAI's, and a request arriving in either
dialect is served by exactly the same machinery behind it.

The design rule that governed the phase was that there must not be a second gateway
hiding inside the first. Routing, failover, the circuit breaker, budget enforcement,
the bring-your-own-key isolation, guardrails, the response cache, and the analytics
pipeline are difficult precisely because they are careful, and duplicating them for a
second protocol would mean maintaining two subtly diverging copies of the most
important code in the project. So the Anthropic endpoint owns none of that. It
translates the incoming request into the canonical OpenAI shape, hands it to the same
function that already serves OpenAI traffic, and translates whatever comes back. The
core does not know, and does not need to know, which dialect the caller spoke.

Making the response translation invisible to that core was the interesting part. The
core writes its answer — a JSON body, or a stream of server-sent events — to a reply
object. Rather than teach it a second output format, the Anthropic route hands it a
stand-in reply that looks exactly like the real one and quietly translates every write
on its way to the socket. A non-streaming completion becomes an Anthropic message; an
error becomes an Anthropic error envelope with the right type for its status; and a
streamed OpenAI response is re-framed, event by event, into Anthropic's flow of a
message opening, a content block opening, a run of deltas, the block closing, a final
delta bearing the stop reason, and the message closing. The translation happens on the
wire, never by collecting the whole answer first, so the time a user waits for the first
token is unchanged.

The two formats disagree about structure, not merely about names, and the streaming
translator is where that shows. OpenAI streams flat fragments; Anthropic frames a
message as a sequence of self-contained content blocks, each opened and closed in turn,
with tool calls appearing as their own blocks distinct from text. The translator is a
small state machine that opens a text block when the first text arrives, closes it and
opens a tool block when a tool call begins, streams the tool's arguments as they trickle
in, and closes everything cleanly at the end — even for an empty response, which still
must be a well-formed message. Requests are translated in the other direction with the
same care: a top-level system prompt becomes a leading message, tool definitions and
tool results and image blocks are each mapped across, and the model the caller named is
replaced with the gateway's own, because Nexus decides the model, not the client.

Because Anthropic clients present their key in a different header, the authenticator now
accepts it either as a bearer token or as the header Anthropic uses, and the
model-discovery endpoint returns a description broad enough that a client of either
dialect reads what it expects. The whole path is covered by unit tests: the request and
response translations, the error mapping, and the streaming state machine driven through
recorded fragment sequences for plain text, for tool calls, for a response split
awkwardly across network reads, and for the empty case. A separate suite drives the
reply stand-in exactly as the core does and confirms Anthropic events emerge on the
socket. What remains is to point Claude Code at a running gateway and watch a real
session, which is a live check rather than a code one.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 6.1 — Model-First Routing  

**Summary:**  
Until now the gateway decided which model to run from a field on the pool. A pool is a
provider's credentials — a base URL, an authentication scheme, and one or more keys —
and hanging a single model off it meant one key could serve exactly one model, while
the Models registry that operators actually edit did not influence routing at all.
Worse, the two disagreed silently: a request recorded its cost by matching the pool's
model string against the registry, and when the two did not line up the request was
booked at zero. Selecting a model in the Models tab did nothing; the pool always won.

Routing now walks models rather than pools. The registry is the source of truth for
which model runs, its tier, and its priority. Selection considers every active model
that declares the requested capability and whose provider has a configured pool, orders
them by tier, then by priority, then — when cost-aware routing is enabled — by price
within a tier, and for the best model finds a healthy key belonging to its provider.
The consequence operators asked for falls straight out of this: a single Anthropic key
can now serve a premium model and a fast model at the same time, because the tier lives
on the model, not on the credential. The mechanics that make routing safe — the circuit
breaker, atomic admission, the bring-your-own-key ownership filter, and sticky
cache-affinity — are untouched; only the outer choice of what to attempt changed, and
each selected key still passes through exactly the same gates.

Every model now carries a set of capabilities — chat, completion, embedding, image,
speech, transcription — which is the foundation the coming protocol work stands on. An
endpoint asks for a capability and only models that declare it are eligible, so the
Anthropic Messages endpoint and the embedding, image, and audio endpoints that follow
will each select from the same registry without a second routing path. A model with no
declared capability is treated as a chat model, and a legacy tool-completion flag is
read as the completion capability, so nothing an operator configured before is lost.

The transition was built to be invisible. The registry begins empty rather than
shipping phantom default models that would route to providers nobody configured, and on
startup any active pool that still carries a model contributes a registry entry with its
tier and the chat capability, so an upgraded deployment routes exactly as it did the day
before. Should the registry ever be empty when a chat request arrives, the old
pool-tier walk still answers it, so there is no version in which upgrading takes the
gateway offline. The pool's model field remains, now optional and labelled as legacy.

Two long-standing defects were closed along the way. A request whose model was missing
from the registry is no longer booked at zero cost, because usage is now attributed to
the real model the router chose. And the endpoint that saves the registry, which
previously stored whatever it received, now validates every entry and refuses duplicate
identifiers or duplicate provider-and-model pairs, either of which would have made
selection non-deterministic.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 6 — Security & Auth Hardening  

**Summary:**  
The admin password, the gateway's API key, and the metrics token were each compared
with a plain equality check. String equality abandons the comparison at the first
byte that differs, so the time taken to reject a wrong guess reveals how many leading
characters were right, and a patient caller can recover a secret one character at a
time. All three now go through a constant-time comparison over fixed-width digests,
which also sidesteps the trap that the underlying primitive rejects operands of
unequal length — a naive guard against that would itself have disclosed the length of
the secret. Team keys were never affected; they have always been hashed lookups.

The larger problem was structural, and the phase could not be honestly delivered
without confronting it. The dashboard held the administrator's password in browser
storage and presented it as the bearer token on every request. A second factor cannot
be attached to an arrangement like that. A second factor exists to make a login
produce a credential that proves the factor was satisfied; if the credential is the
password itself, then anyone who has the password never encounters the factor at all.
Adding a code prompt to the sign-in screen while leaving password-bearer authentication
in place would have looked like two-factor authentication and protected nothing.

Signing in therefore now exchanges the password, and an authenticator code once one is
enrolled, for a short-lived session token. Only that token is stored by the browser,
which also removes the administrator's password from the reach of any cross-site
scripting on the page — a category of flaw this project has had to fix twice in the
last week. Once a second factor is confirmed, the password stops being accepted as a
bearer token on the administrative API, because leaving it accepted would restore the
bypass the factor exists to close. Scripts and continuous integration, which cannot
present a code, authenticate instead with named administrative tokens that are stored
hashed, listed in the dashboard, and revocable. Before anyone enrols a factor,
everything behaves exactly as it did, so upgrading changes nothing.

The time-based algorithm itself is implemented against node's cryptography rather than
taken from a package. It is a keyed hash, a truncation, and a modulo, and both governing
specifications publish test vectors — so its correctness is demonstrated by those
vectors rather than assumed, and the most security-sensitive path in the project takes
on no third-party code. Verification accepts one time step of clock drift in either
direction, compares every candidate in constant time, and deliberately does not stop at
the first match, because an early exit would make a correct-but-skewed code faster to
check than a wrong one and thereby disclose the device's clock offset.

Enrolment is deliberately two-staged. A secret is minted and stored encrypted but
inert; nothing about authentication changes until a code proves the operator actually
holds it. An enrolment abandoned halfway therefore cannot lock anybody out of their own
gateway. Confirmation issues ten single-use recovery codes, shown once and retained
only as hashes, any one of which substitutes for the authenticator when a phone is
lost.

Repeated sign-in failures now lock the originating address out for a fixed window and
return the wait time. A correct password offers no escape from an active lockout, and a
wrong password is reported identically to a wrong code, so the form cannot be used to
learn whether a password was right before the second factor was reached. Sign-in
outcomes are counted by result, because a rising rate of rejections is how an operator
learns someone is guessing.

Finally the schema gained a table for custom domains, each with its own verification
state and challenge token, ahead of the interface that will drive it — a table rather
than a column, because a team may map more than one hostname and each has to be proven
separately, and because discovering that halfway through a user-interface phase would
mean migrating the database in the middle of it.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Startup Diagnostics — Saying What Is Missing  

**Summary:**  
Starting the gateway without Redis produced about twenty identical connection-refused
stack traces, each several lines deep, and then terminated with a message about a
retry limit and an option name. Every fact an operator needed was absent: which
service was unreachable, at which address, whether it was required, and what to run.
The gateway was behaving correctly — it depends on Redis and Postgres, and refusing to
start without them is right — but it was reporting that correctness as though it were
an internal fault.

Startup now verifies both dependencies before doing any other work, using the same
clients the application itself uses, so a pass means the configuration is sound rather
than merely that something is listening on a port. A failure prints one short block:
the service, the host and port it was looked for at, the underlying reason, the
command that starts it, and a one-line explanation of what that service holds and why
it cannot simply be skipped. The stack trace is dropped, because the stack of a
refused connection describes the network library, not the problem. Genuine internal
errors keep their stacks.

The address in that message is derived rather than echoed. Connection strings commonly
carry a password, and a startup failure is written to standard output and swept into
log aggregation, so the URL is reduced to a host and port before it is printed and an
unparseable value degrades to a constant rather than being repeated verbatim. That
property is pinned by tests, since a regression there would leak a credential into
logs that outlive the process.

Reconnection noise during ordinary operation was addressed at the same time. The
driver emits an error for every retry, and logging the full object each time buries
the single line that matters. The first occurrence is now logged as one line, and
subsequent ones are collapsed into a periodic count.

The message also points anyone who only wants to look at the dashboard toward serving
it on its own, which needs neither database nor gateway. Two long-standing errors in
the setup documentation were corrected while the path was being walked: the dashboard
is served at the root, not under a separate path, and the manual instructions never
mentioned that the two dependencies had to be running before the server would start.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Dashboard — Verifying the Preview, and a Regression the Move Introduced  

**Summary:**  
Every section of the dashboard's server-less preview was exercised in a real browser
rather than reasoned about: the endpoint panel, the provider pools with their key
tables and utilisation meters, the model registry, the team keys, all four analytics
charts, and the settings cards. All render, and no script error is raised anywhere in
the walk. The preview needs neither a database nor a running gateway, which makes it
the fastest honest check that the dashboard still works after any change to it.

The exercise was prompted by a genuine defect, and it found one. Splitting the
dashboard into ES modules made it lintable and reviewable, but it also made it
unopenable: a browser refuses to load a module from a filesystem origin, so
double-clicking the page now renders the login screen with every button silently
inert. Nothing is logged, nothing is thrown, and the natural conclusion is that the
dashboard is broken. The previous single-file page had no such constraint. A classic
script — one that a browser *will* load from the filesystem, and which therefore still
runs when the module graph cannot — now detects that origin and replaces the login box
with the command needed to serve the page properly. A silent failure has been turned
into an instruction.

The preview's provider tables were also a version behind: they still showed the four
columns that existed before keys could be owned by a team. They now carry the owner
column, with one key attributed to a team and the rest to the shared pool, so the
preview shows the product as it actually is rather than as it was.

Finally, the local preview configuration had been pointing at a directory that ceased
to exist when the project was renamed, which is why the dashboard could not be served
during earlier sessions and why its behaviour had been argued about rather than
observed. It points at the right place now.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Brand — Generated Banners for README, X, and the Social Card  

**Summary:**  
The project now has a banner set: a hero for the top of the README, a header sized for
an X profile, and the social card GitHub serves when the repository is linked
anywhere. All three are generated rather than drawn. A build script lifts the crest
out of the canonical artwork and composes each layout around it, so the mark cannot
drift out of sync across surfaces the way hand-maintained exports always eventually
do. Editing the crest and re-running the script updates every banner at once.

Two constraints shaped the layouts. X renders a profile header at roughly a fifth of
its upload canvas, so that variant carries larger type, drops the fine print, and
seats the crest on the right, where the profile avatar — itself the crest — cannot
overlap it. And because both X and GitHub re-compress on high-density displays, the
exports ship at twice their nominal size; the single-density files are kept only as
fallbacks and are explicitly marked as the wrong thing to upload. The brand
documentation now records which file belongs on which surface, so the question does
not have to be answered twice.

The hero reference had been added to the README a commit earlier while the image
itself was still untracked, which left the front page of the repository showing a
broken image for the few minutes between the two pushes. Both are now committed
together.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 5.6 — Structural Split, Architecture Docs, and a Silent Packaging Defect  

**Summary:**  
The gateway's backend layering has been sound from the beginning — pure, unit-tested
logic in one directory, side effects in another, HTTP handling in a third — but two
files had grown past the point where that discipline was visible. The dashboard was a
single document carrying its own markup, stylesheet, and every line of its behaviour,
and the admin API had become one flat sequence of thirty handlers. Neither was
incorrect. Both were becoming unreviewable, and a file nobody wants to open is where
defects go to live quietly.

This session moved them apart without changing what either does. The dashboard now
lives under a directory named for what it is, its stylesheet extracted, its behaviour
split into a small module per section and an entry point that composes them. The admin
API is now one file per resource, with the authentication guard defined once so a new
sub-router cannot accidentally publish an unauthenticated endpoint. The route paths,
request shapes, and responses are untouched; the entire test suite passed before and
after with no edits.

The one deliberate compromise is a bridge in the entry point that republishes the
dashboard's handler functions onto the global object, because roughly sixty inline
event attributes in the markup still call them by name. Converting those to delegated
listeners is correct and is coming, but doing it inside a commit that already moves
two thousand lines would have made any regression untraceable. The bridge is marked
for deletion in the redesign that follows.

Splitting the dashboard into real modules had an immediate and unplanned benefit: it
became lintable. The linter, run against it for the first time, found two functions
that the split had separated from the code calling them — a latent break the move
itself would otherwise have shipped. Because the previous single-file dashboard could
not be linted at all, those checks now run on every commit, and the whole module graph
is additionally exercised outside a browser to prove that every section still loads and
every bridged handler resolves.

Auditing the packaging for the directory rename surfaced something considerably more
serious than the rename. The container image had never copied the dashboard's static
files into its runtime stage. The static-file plugin does not treat a missing root as
fatal — it emits a warning and continues — so every published image started cleanly,
passed its healthcheck, served the API correctly, and returned a bare 404 to anyone who
opened it in a browser. The defect is the same shape as the migration problem found
earlier: a container that starts is not a container that works, and both were invisible
precisely because the failure was silent. The image now carries the dashboard, and the
changelog tells existing users which releases were affected.

A separate finding, raised against the routing sweep, was that the tier-downgrade flag
carried no information. It was assigned before the first routing attempt in every tier,
so by the time it was read it was always true and the expression reduced to "we are not
in the first tier". Simply deleting the redundant term would have preserved the
behaviour, but the behaviour was itself wrong: an operator who had never configured a
premium provider was told that every single request had been downgraded. The flag now
records whether a higher tier existed, held providers, and failed to serve — which is
what a downgrade is. An empty tier is skipped, because there was nothing to fall back
from. Five tests pin the distinction.

Finally, the repository gained an architecture directory. One document explains the
layering rule, walks a request end to end through admission, breaker, scope, cache, and
usage, and states which direction dependencies are allowed to point. The other is a
where-to-look index of every source file plus a short checklist for adding a feature.
The internal planning notes remain private; only these two are published.

**Date:** 2026-07-10 · Session 21  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 5.5 — BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)  

**Summary:**  
A provider key may now be owned by a team rather than sitting in the shared pool. An
owned key is encrypted with the same AES-256-GCM path as every other credential, and
it serves only its owner's traffic. Routing resolves in two passes: the team's own
keys first, in the usual tier order with least-recently-used selection inside a tier,
and then — only when the team permits it — the shared pool. A team that disables
fall-back is hard-isolated: once its own keys are exhausted it receives a 503 with a
retry window, never a credential it did not bring. Teams that own no keys are
untouched by any of this and continue to use the shared pool exactly as before.

The governing constraint was that BYOK must not become a second code path. It has not.
Ownership lives on the credential, not on the provider, so an owned key inherits the
provider's shared configuration — base URL, tier, model, auth scheme — and passes
through the identical admission control, circuit breaker, guardrail evaluation, SSRF
validation, and analytics pipeline as a pooled key. Scoping is expressed as an equality
filter on the key query and a second sweep of the same tier-selection routine. The
proxy's request path grew by roughly a dozen lines; nothing was forked.

Two isolation boundaries required work that the phase brief did not anticipate, and
both were found by auditing the existing code rather than by writing the new feature.
The first is sticky routing. A session's pin to its last-successful key lives in Redis
and outlives any individual request, so a pin established while a caller was on the
shared pool would have been honoured later for an isolated team, and the reverse. Pins
are now re-authorised against the caller's scope on every use, and an ineligible pin
simply falls through to ordinary discovery. The second is the response cache, whose
identity was derived from the request content alone. Left as it was, a response paid
for by one team's private key would have been replayed from Redis to another team, and
an isolated team could have received an answer its own keys never produced. The cache
key is now partitioned by routing scope, and both the scope used for routing and the
scope used for caching are derived from a single resolved value, so the two cannot
drift apart. Existing cached entries are ignored after upgrade and the cache
repopulates over one expiry window.

Deleting a team destroys the provider keys it owns. Every other relation in the schema
nulls its foreign key on delete, and following that convention here would have quietly
released a team's private credentials into the shared pool for every other caller to
route through. The delete endpoint reports how many owned keys went with the team, and
the behaviour is documented rather than merely implemented. Access keys are unaffected
and survive unassigned, losing only their budget cap. Spend on owned keys continues to
be costed, attributed, and counted against the team's cap; an operator who funds a
team's own credentials simply leaves that team's budget unset.

Observability follows the same principle as the rest of the gateway — a sustained
fall-back rate is an operational signal, not an error — so the new counter records
whether each request from a key-owning team was served by its own key, by the pool
after its own keys were exhausted, or refused under isolation. Responses from an owned
key are labelled in the headers alongside the existing tier and provider fields.

This session also cleared the outstanding code-scanning findings on the dashboard.
Values that originate outside the gateway — provider base URLs, team and key names,
error text — are now escaped before they reach the document, and the copy buttons
carry their payload in a data attribute read by a single delegated listener instead of
being interpolated into an inline handler where a quote could break out. Separately, an
optimistic write to the model registry no longer survives a rejected save, a button
left in an error state now recovers, and the analytics charts index their series once
rather than rescanning the result set for every plotted point.

Migration 0004 is additive: existing keys carry no owner, which is precisely the shared
pool, and existing routing behaviour is unchanged on upgrade.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 4.5 — Response Caching (Exact-Match)  

**Summary:**  
Added an optional response cache — the real-money complement to the cache-aware
routing shipped earlier, and a genuinely different mechanism: rather than reusing a
provider's own prompt cache, this caches the response itself. When enabled, a request
that exactly matches an earlier one — same model, same messages, same generation
parameters — is answered straight from Redis, skipping the provider entirely. That is
a true zero-cost call, not merely a cheaper one.

The design keeps the gateway's contracts intact. The cache is checked before routing,
so only a miss falls through to provider selection; on a hit nothing downstream runs.
The cache identity ignores whether the caller asked for streaming, so a streamed and a
non-streamed request with identical content share one entry, and a hit is replayed in
whichever mode the caller wants — a streamed hit is delivered as server-sent events for
drop-in compatibility. Populating the cache from a streamed response reuses the buffer
the streaming path already assembles for token accounting, adding no second copy. Every
hit still emits a distinct usage event, valued at zero provider cost but attributed to
the requesting team, so cost and analytics figures never silently drift and a free hit
does not draw down a team's budget. Tool-call responses and multi-choice requests are
deliberately left uncached, since a single stored answer cannot faithfully stand in for
them.

Caching is off by default and configurable from the dashboard or the environment, with
a time-to-live governing freshness. Responses are tagged so a caller and the metrics
endpoint can see hits, misses, and stores. Added unit coverage for the cache-key
identity rules, the eligibility checks, and the streamed-content assembly (123 tests
total, all green), and documented the feature — including how it differs from cache-
aware routing — in the README. Semantic caching remains a noted, heavier extension for
a later phase.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Release v1.1.0 — Teams & Budgets, Observability, and an Important Install Fix  

**Summary:**  
Tagged and published version 1.1.0, bundling the work since launch into one coherent
release: the team and budget hierarchy with admission-path enforcement, the
Prometheus metrics endpoint with optional distributed tracing, the copy-paste client
connection guide, and — most importantly for anyone installing fresh — the fix that
makes database migrations genuinely apply at container startup. Users of the 1.0.0
single-container quickstart should upgrade to 1.1.0, which provisions a fresh
database correctly; upgrade notes for existing deployments are in the changelog.
The multi-architecture container image for 1.1.0 is published to the registry under
the same name, and the package version now tracks the release version.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 5 — Teams, Budget Hierarchy, and a Migration-Pipeline Fix  

**Summary:**  
Introduced a real team entity. Until now a "team key" was just a named access token;
there was no team to attach members, budgets, or policy to. Teams now group scoped
access keys and carry a spending budget — a USD cap per day, week, or month — plus a
status and an assigned routing tier (stored now, wired into the dashboard's Teams
tab in an upcoming phase). The model is deliberately shaped so a parent organization
level can wrap it later with a single additive column, no restructuring required.

Budget enforcement rides the admission path, before any provider work happens. A key
belonging to a team that has exhausted its budget receives a clear rejection with the
current spend, the cap, and exactly when the window resets; a suspended team's keys
are refused outright. Spend is tracked in Redis for per-request cheapness but seeded
from the real recorded usage history on a cache miss — so a cap set mid-period starts
from what the team has genuinely spent, and budgets survive a Redis restart. Because
cost on a streaming gateway is only knowable after a response completes, enforcement
is check-then-spend: requests already in flight when a cap is crossed can overshoot
by their own cost, a documented and standard trade. Keys without a team, and teams
without a cap, behave exactly as before. A new admin API manages teams (list with
live period spend, create, update, delete) and assigns keys to teams; the Teams
dashboard tab will consume it in the UI rebuild phase.

The phase also surfaced and fixed a real deployment bug: the migration files were
flat SQL that the container's startup migration step silently ignored, leaving a
fresh single-container database with no tables at all. Migrations now use the
standard layout and genuinely apply in order at startup, and the compose file's
init-mount workaround was removed. Existing deployments created by the old path
baseline once with two commands, documented in the changelog.

Added unit coverage for the budget window math (including ISO-week year boundaries),
the seed-from-history path, and the allow/block decision (111 tests total, all
green), and documented teams, budgets, and the new endpoints in the README.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 4.6 — Observability: Prometheus /metrics and Optional OpenTelemetry  

**Summary:**  
Added a scrapeable, Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint so the gateway drops
straight into an existing operations stack. The endpoint exposes the shape an
operator actually needs: request rate and duration broken down by outcome and tier,
the upstream time-to-first-byte, input and output tokens, the prompt-cache hit rate
from sticky routing, per-provider request and error rates classified by cause
(rate limit, auth, server, timeout), pool utilization as active/cooling/banned key
counts, and the standard process and runtime metrics. Counters and histograms are
updated cheaply in memory on the request path; the pool gauges are refreshed from the
database per scrape.

The endpoint is guarded rather than world-readable: a scraper authenticates with a
dedicated metrics token (falling back to the admin password if none is set), and it
is exempted from the abuse-guard rate limit but never from authentication — reusing
the same allow-list pattern the health check uses. Distributed tracing is available
but optional: the gateway-to-provider call is wrapped in an OpenTelemetry span that
is a no-op with zero overhead unless the operator runs the app with an OpenTelemetry
SDK, at which point the spans are exported and correlated automatically.

Added unit coverage for the metrics recording paths and exposition (99 tests total,
all green) and documented scraping and tracing setup in the README. Two small
dependencies were added (the Prometheus client and the OpenTelemetry API); the
production dependency audit remains clean.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Move Repository and Container Image Under the Alayra Systems Organization  

**Summary:**  
Moved the project to its permanent home under the Alayra Systems organization,
matching the ownership to the brand now that Alayra Nexus™ is a distinct Alayra
Systems product rather than a sibling hosted alongside the Kinetic IDE line. The
repository transfer preserves all history, releases, and stars, and the previous
location redirects automatically, so existing links and clones keep working.

Every reference the project controls was repointed to the new organization: the
repository URLs across the README badges, contributor guide, changelog links, issue
templates, and the container image's source label, plus the maintainer and project
links. The published container image moves with it — the release workflow now
publishes to the organization's own registry namespace, and the quickstart and
badges reference the new image path. References to the separate Kinetic IDE product
and its website are intentionally left untouched, since that remains its own product.

No application behaviour changes. Green gate: lint 0, typecheck 0, 93 tests pass,
build 0. The v1.0.0 tag was re-cut so the image republishes under the new namespace.

**Date:** 2026-07-09 · Session 15  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Packaging & Release Readiness — Multi-Arch Container Image, CHANGELOG, and Versioning  

**Summary:**  
Made Alayra Nexus™ installable as a first-class package rather than a repository you
clone and build. A release workflow now builds a multi-architecture image (Intel and
ARM, so it runs natively on cloud instances and Apple Silicon alike) and publishes it
to the GitHub Container Registry on every version tag, meaning an operator can run the
gateway with a single command against their own Postgres and Redis, without cloning
anything. The container was hardened for production distribution: a build-time ignore
file keeps dependencies, git history, brand assets, and — critically — environment
files out of the image, closing a secret-leak path; the runtime image drops root and
runs as an unprivileged user; a container healthcheck reports liveness against the
service's own health endpoint; and standard image metadata records the title, source,
license, and vendor.

Adopted formal versioning: the project now follows semantic versioning with a
Keep-a-Changelog changelog, and the public routing contract (the single virtual model
name) is the surface that versioning covers. The README leads with a no-clone
"published image" quickstart alongside the existing Compose and manual paths, and
carries release and container badges.

Green gate: lint 0, typecheck 0, 93 tests pass, build 0, npm audit 0 vulns. (The
container image itself is built and verified by the release workflow in CI. A
follow-up hardened the image to install OpenSSL in both the build and runtime
Alpine stages, so the Prisma query engine resolves the correct OpenSSL 3.x variant
and starts cleanly.)

**Date:** 2026-07-09 · Session 14  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 4 — Async Analytics Pipeline  

**Summary:**  
Decoupled analytics writes from the request path. Previously every proxied request
wrote its usage record to Postgres with an individual insert; at scale those
per-request inserts compete with the transactional key-lookup queries on the same
database. Usage events are now handed to an in-process pipeline that buffers them
and writes them to Postgres in a single batched insert, either on a short interval
(about one and a half seconds by default) or as soon as the buffer reaches a size
threshold. The request path no longer waits on the analytics write at all.

The pipeline is deliberately hidden behind a single `emit(event)` call. Swapping the
in-process buffer for a durable queue later — a managed queue, or a streaming path
into a columnar store if the project ever needs that scale — is a change to one
module, not a change to every caller. That is the cheap-now, expensive-to-retrofit
seam being put in early. The buffer is bounded so a database outage sheds load
rather than growing memory without limit, a failed flush re-queues rather than
dropping data, batched inserts are chunked and idempotent so a retry cannot
duplicate rows, and a graceful-shutdown drain flushes anything still buffered before
the process exits. Combined with the real tokenizer from Phase 2, the same pipe now
carries accurate numbers rather than guesses.

Added unit coverage for the buffering, size-threshold flush, failure re-queue,
load-shedding cap, and drain behaviours (93 tests total, all green).

**Date:** 2026-07-09 · Session 13  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Brand Identity — Three-Tier Alayra Nexus™ Logo System  

**Summary:**  
Established a formal visual identity for Alayra Nexus™: a three-tier logo system
built around a cyan neon vortex converging on a faceted core, with a bronze accent
inherited from the Alayra Systems parent mark. The tiers scale from a ceremonial
crest (with an ALAYRA · NEXUS wordmark lockup for marketing headers), through a
working logo for site and documentation headers, down to a reduced glyph that stays
legible as a favicon or avatar, plus a monochrome recolorable variant. Each mark is
provided as a scalable vector source with rendered raster exports at the sizes each
context needs, together with a short brand guide (usage and palette) and a
regeneration script so the exports can be rebuilt whenever a source is refined.

The kit was wired into the product surfaces: the dashboard now carries the glyph as
its header logo and browser favicon, and the repository README leads with the crest
lockup. The complete asset kit lives in the repository so the identity ships with the
project. The Apache 2.0 license covers the code; the name and logo remain trademarks
of Alayra Systems, as recorded in the trademark policy.

**Date:** 2026-07-09 · Session 12  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Rebrand to Alayra Nexus™ and Relicense under Apache 2.0  

**Summary:**  
Renamed the project from Kinetic Nexus to **Alayra Nexus™** across the codebase,
dashboard, documentation, and package metadata, and moved the repository to its new
home. The change is purely one of name and branding — no functional behaviour is
affected. Internal identifiers that never carried the old brand (Redis key
namespaces, response headers, and environment variables) are unchanged, so existing
deployments and integrations continue to work without modification.

The public virtual model identifier is now **`alayra-nexus-1`**, with the previous
`kinetic-nexus-1` and `nexus` strings preserved as silent backward-compatible
aliases so no existing client request breaks. The trademark symbol is applied to the
brand in the primary interfaces.

Alongside the rename, the project's license was changed from MIT to the **Apache
License, Version 2.0**, chosen to keep the project fully open source while adding an
explicit patent grant and an explicit statement that the license conveys no
trademark rights. A standard Apache copyright-and-license header was added to every
source file, and NOTICE and TRADEMARK files were added to record the copyright and
the name/logo usage policy. The "Alayra Nexus" name and logo remain trademarks of
Alayra Systems; the open-source license covers the code, not the brand.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 11  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Cost-Aware Routing — Bias Toward the Cheapest Healthy, In-Headroom Provider  

**Summary:**  
Added a cost dimension to the router, completing the load / cost / latency /
capability picture. When several providers in the same tier are healthy and have
request and token headroom, Nexus can now prefer the cheaper one, using the
per-token pricing already carried in the model registry — no new data source. It is
a tiebreaker only, governed by a single cost-weight knob from 0 to 1: zero leaves
the existing provider order untouched (the default, so no deployment changes
behaviour until an operator opts in), one is strict cheapest-first within a tier,
and values in between interpolate, biasing toward cheaper without discarding the
operator's configured order. Unpriced providers rank last but are never dropped.

Correctness comes first by construction. Cost is applied only in the fallback
selection path, after sticky cache affinity — a continuing conversation stays pinned
to the key holding its prompt cache even when a cheaper provider exists, because a
cache hit usually wins on total cost. It sits within a tier, never across tiers, so
capability is never traded for price. And it reorders only which providers are
*tried*: every candidate still passes the circuit breaker and the atomic
rate/token-headroom check, so a cheaper provider that is cooling or over its limits
is still skipped — cost can never promote an ineligible key. The weight is editable
live from a new Cost-aware routing panel in the dashboard Settings tab, backed by a
new admin endpoint, and can also be seeded from an environment variable.

Added unit coverage for the pricing signal and the ordering blend, including the
sticky/eligibility guarantees at the boundaries (87 tests total, all green), and
documented the feature and its ordering rules in the README.

---

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 10  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Guardrails — Optional, Pluggable Prompt and Response Content Filtering  

**Summary:**  
Added an optional content-guardrails layer that lets an operator redact sensitive
data or block banned content and prompt-injection patterns, without Nexus imposing
any policy of its own. It is off by default — a fresh deployment filters nothing —
and operators supply their own rules as a simple ruleset, with named starting-point
presets (email, phone, card, SSN, API key, and injection patterns) available to copy.

Filtering follows the request lifecycle deliberately. Input rules run on the
admission path before a request is ever forwarded: a blocking rule rejects the call
outright, and a redaction rule masks the match and forwards the cleaned prompt.
Output rules apply to non-streaming responses, where the full body is already
available to inspect. The streaming path is intentionally zero-buffer for latency,
so streamed responses are input-filtered only by default and are marked with an
explicit header rather than being silently passed through unfiltered; an operator
who needs output filtering on streams can opt into a buffered-safe mode that collects
the response, filters it, and replays it as a single chunk, accepting the loss of
streaming latency as a conscious trade.

The ruleset and its toggles are managed live from a new Content guardrails panel in
the dashboard Settings tab, backed by new admin endpoints, and can also be seeded
from environment variables. Rule patterns are validated when saved so a bad
expression is caught at configuration time, malformed rules are skipped rather than
allowed to break the request path, and the amount of text scanned per field is
capped to keep filtering inexpensive. Added unit coverage for the filtering engine
(75 tests total, all green), documented the feature and the streaming trade-off in
the README, and verified the new settings panel renders in the dashboard.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 9  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Network Security — SSRF Protection with Default-On Private-Host Blocking and an Opt-In Allowlist  

**Summary:**  
Hardened the gateway's outbound requests against server-side request forgery. Because
Nexus fetches operator-configured provider base URLs, an unrestricted URL could be
aimed at internal-only addresses — cloud metadata, loopback services, or private LAN
hosts — and use the gateway as a proxy into its own network. Requests to private,
loopback, link-local, and internal-name hosts are now refused by default across every
path that adds or uses a provider URL: a bad URL is rejected the moment a provider is
created or updated, so it never reaches the request path, and the proxy path re-checks
as defense in depth.

Operators who run a legitimate local provider (Ollama, LM Studio) can permit exactly
the host they need rather than turning the protection off wholesale. A new *Network
security* panel in the dashboard Settings tab lets an admin toggle private-host
blocking and manage an allowlist of specific hosts live, backed by new admin endpoints;
the same values can be seeded from environment variables, which the dashboard settings
build on top of. The default posture is secure — blocking on, allowlist empty — so a
fresh deployment is protected without any configuration.

Added a private-host classifier covering IPv4 and IPv6 ranges (including cloud-metadata
and IPv4-mapped addresses) and the URL validator, with unit coverage for the blocking,
allowlist, and disabled-blocking paths (64 tests total, all green). Documented the
feature and the local-provider workflow in the README, and verified the new settings
panel renders in the dashboard.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 8  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 3 — Resilience: Circuit Breaker + Cache-Aware Sticky Routing  

**Summary:**  
Replaced the single flat cooldown with a real per-key circuit breaker and added
cache-aware sticky routing, so the gateway both fails gracefully and stops wasting
provider prompt caches. All breaker state lives in Redis, keeping it atomic and
consistent across replicas with no database writes on the hot path.

The breaker distinguishes the kinds of failure a provider can return. Server-side
faults (5xx, upstream timeouts, and streams that connect but hang) accumulate as
strikes and trip the breaker after three consecutive failures in a five-minute
window. Each trip escalates the cooldown — ten seconds, then twenty, then forty,
doubling to a ten-minute ceiling — so a key that keeps failing is pushed further
away rather than retried on the same fixed timer indefinitely. When a cooldown
expires the router admits exactly one half-open probe: success closes the breaker
and resets the streak, while failure re-escalates without returning full traffic to
a still-unhealthy provider. Rate-limit responses (429) are handled separately on
their own flat, non-escalating cooldown, and two consecutive authentication
failures (401/403) ban a key outright, since a bad credential does not recover on
its own. Any success at any point resets the streak, and the dashboard's cooling and
banned states — plus the admin unban action — stay in step with the live breaker.

Cache-aware sticky routing pins a multi-turn conversation to the key that last
served it, so follow-up turns reuse the upstream provider's prompt cache instead of
being scattered across the pool by least-recently-used rotation. A session is
identified by an explicit `X-Nexus-Session` header, the OpenAI `user` field, or a
stable fingerprint of the opening messages, and falls back to normal tier and LRU
selection for new sessions or when the pinned key is unavailable. The routing
contract remains a single virtual model (`kinetic-nexus-1` — the pre-rebrand
identifier; now `alayra-nexus-1`, which still accepts the old id as an alias); this
decision is now documented so early adopters can depend on it.

Added unit tests for the breaker escalation curve and thresholds and for the
session-fingerprinting logic (51 tests total, all green), and documented both the
breaker behaviour and sticky routing in the README.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Security Hardening — Resolve CodeQL Alerts (XSS, ReDoS, URL Validation, CI Permissions)  

**Summary:**  
Addressed the security alerts raised by GitHub CodeQL scanning. Added an
HTML-escaping helper to the dashboard and applied it to the model card and model
form renderers so a model or provider name containing markup can no longer be
reinterpreted as HTML (cross-site scripting); verified in a browser that a hostile
name renders as inert escaped text and executes nothing. Introduced a small URL
utility (`src/lib/url.ts`): a non-regex trailing-slash strip that removes a
potential polynomial-backtracking (ReDoS) pattern, and a scheme validator that
restricts outbound provider requests to http(s), blocking `file:` and similar
schemes through the gateway's fetch. Wired both into the key-test, provider-
credential, model-validation, and proxy paths. Added a least-privilege
`permissions: contents: read` block to the CI workflow.

Added unit tests for the URL utility (36 tests total, all green) and a CI status
badge to the README so the passing checks are visible on the repository's front
page. The remaining CodeQL "missing rate limiting" notices concern admin routes
that are already covered by the global per-credential abuse guard and admin
authentication.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 6  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 2 — Real Admission Control: Atomic RPM/TPM, Tokenizer, Reservation, and Upstream Timeouts  

**Summary:**  
Replaced the request-admission path with real, race-free budget enforcement.
Previously each key's requests-per-minute counter was checked and then incremented
in two separate Redis calls, so under concurrency several requests could pass a
check only one should have; tokens-per-minute limits were stored but never
enforced; and input token counts were a crude character-count divided by four.

Introduced an atomic admission primitive (`src/lib/admission.ts`): a single Redis
Lua script that checks both the RPM and TPM budgets and, only if both have
headroom, increments the request counter and reserves the request's estimated
tokens — in one atomic operation. Pool selection (`nexus.service.ts`) now calls
this per key and rotates to the next key or tier when a key is out of either
budget, only failing the request once the entire pool is exhausted (rotate first,
fail last).

Added a real tokenizer (`src/lib/tokenizer.ts`, built on `js-tiktoken`) to
estimate a request's input tokens before it is forwarded, replacing the
character-count heuristic. Each request reserves `estimated input + max_tokens`
against the chosen key's TPM budget; when the response completes, the reservation
is reconciled down to the provider's real token usage, and a failed request
releases its full reservation.

Hardened the upstream call in the completions proxy with three independent
timeouts: a time-to-first-byte deadline (abort if the provider never returns
headers), a body-read deadline for non-streaming responses, and an idle-gap
deadline for streaming responses (a hung stream is aborted while a legitimately
long one keeps flowing as chunks arrive). All three are environment-configurable.

Added unit tests for the tokenizer, the reservation math, and the admission key
derivation (29 tests total, all green), and documented the new environment
variables in the README and `.env.example`.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 5  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Community Health Files, Security Policy, and Dependency Automation Hardening  

**Summary:**  
Added the standard open-source community health set so the repository is ready for
external contributors and reporters. Wrote `SECURITY.md` with a private
vulnerability-disclosure process (report to `report-nexus@alayrasystems.com`),
scope, and a no-secrets-in-reports rule. Wrote `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering local
setup, the required check gate (`lint` / `typecheck` / `test` / `build`), the pull
request process, and commit conventions. Added a pull request template and two
structured GitHub issue forms (bug report and feature request) with an issue
template config that routes security reports and questions to the right place.
Added a `FUNDING.yml` sponsor configuration.

Hardened the Dependabot configuration: grouped the Prisma client and CLI packages
so they always upgrade together (a mismatched bump breaks client generation), and
configured it to skip breaking major-version Prisma upgrades so they are performed
deliberately rather than via automated pull requests.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 4  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Launch Readiness — CI Pipeline, Test Suite, Linting, and Zero-Vulnerability Dependency Tree  

**Summary:**  
Prepared the repository for public release with a full automated verification gate so that every push is provably green. Added ESLint (flat config, TypeScript-aware) with `lint`/`lint:fix` scripts — the entire source tree passes with zero errors and zero warnings. Added Vitest with an initial test suite of 14 tests: AES-256-GCM encryption round-trip, random-IV uniqueness, GCM tamper rejection, ciphertext-format validation, key masking, and the Phase 1 rate-limit key derivation (per-credential hashing, IP fallback, determinism, and no-raw-token-leak guarantees). Added `typecheck`, `test`, and `test:watch` scripts.

Added a GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs lint, typecheck, test, build, and a dependency audit on every push and pull request to `main`, with a production-dependency audit as a hard security gate. Added a Dependabot configuration for weekly npm and GitHub Actions updates. Upgraded the test tooling so that the dependency tree now reports **zero vulnerabilities** across the board.

Performed final repository hygiene: stripped a UTF-8 byte-order mark from two source files, corrected the repository URL in their MIT license headers, excluded test files from the production build output, and removed an internal editor configuration file from version control.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 3  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 1 — Abuse-Guard Rate Limiter (Removed the Global Throughput Ceiling)  

**Summary:**  
Replaced the flat global rate limit in `src/server.ts` — a blanket 200 requests per minute applied across the entire server, which capped total gateway throughput regardless of how many provider keys were pooled behind it — with a purpose-built abuse guard. The new guard is Redis-backed, so the limit stays correct across horizontally-scaled instances rather than under-counting per replica. It is keyed per credential: the bearer token is SHA-256 hashed (the raw token is never used as, or stored in, a Redis key) so that each team key is isolated to its own bucket and a single leaked or runaway key cannot throttle the whole gateway; requests without valid auth fall back to a per-IP bucket. Health checks are exempted, and the guard fails open if Redis is briefly unreachable so a cache blip can never take the proxy down.

The guard is sized entirely above real pool capacity and is configurable via two new environment variables, `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default 12,000/min per credential) and `ABUSE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`. Documented the critical distinction — real per-key provider RPM/TPM limits are the throughput control; the server guard is only DoS/abuse protection — in a new README section ("Rate limits, explained") and in `.env.example`.

Extracted the key-derivation logic into a pure, unit-tested helper (`src/lib/rateLimitKey.ts`), and replaced two loosely-typed `as Record<string, unknown>` request casts with a proper Fastify request type augmentation (`src/types/fastify.d.ts`), which additionally cleared pre-existing type errors so the project now typechecks cleanly end to end.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 2  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** GitHub Public Launch — README, LICENSE, .gitignore, and Security Audit  

**Summary:**  
Prepared the repository for its first public push to GitHub. Conducted a thorough security audit of every file in the repository to confirm that no sensitive internal details were present before public exposure. Verified through `git log` that the `.env` file containing the `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` had never been committed to version history. Confirmed the `.gitignore` correctly excludes `.env`, `.env.local`, OS artifacts, and editor metadata.

Removed a proprietary copyright header that had been carried over into `src/lib/encryption.ts` and `src/lib/prisma.ts`, replacing each with a clean MIT license attribution line. These were the only contaminated files; the rest of the codebase was confirmed clean.

Wrote a comprehensive `README.md` from scratch — enterprise-grade, with badges, architecture ASCII diagram, provider support table, feature matrix, environment variable reference, security model breakdown, quick-start for both Docker Compose and manual setup, full API reference table, and roadmap checklist. Wrote the MIT `LICENSE` file attributed to Alayra Systems Pvt. Limited. Expanded `.gitignore` to cover logs, OS metadata, coverage directories, Prisma shadow database artifacts, and the `.claude/` internal directory.

Provided GitHub organization profile description for the Alayra Systems Pvt. Limited account, and documented the correct push procedure including `git branch -M main` to align local `master` with GitHub's default `main` branch.

**Date:** 2026-07-08 · Session 1  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase Plan Finalization and Roadmap Update in Docs  

**Summary:**  
Continued from the July 6 feature review. Updated the phase plan documentation under `docs/` to reflect the current state of the project — marking completed phases and establishing the next milestones: alerts/webhook tab, per-team budget caps, CNAME/custom domain support, and an integration test suite. Discussed benchmark expectations for the proxy layer and framed realistic competitive positioning relative to LiteLLM for open-source adoption. Identified five capability gaps (provider breadth, guardrails/moderation hooks, observability ecosystem, SSO/SAML, provider-specific passthrough) and logged them as future phases rather than blockers for the v1.0 release.

Generated the structured prompt for creating `nexus-changes.md` as a standalone public-facing enterprise development log, with explicit instructions to exclude any reference to other internal systems or products.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** LiteLLM Feature Gap Analysis and Benchmark Planning  

**Summary:**  
Continued the feature review session from July 6. Conducted a systematic comparison of Kinetic Nexus against LiteLLM across dimensions including provider breadth, rate limit architecture, observability, and team management. Identified five areas where LiteLLM currently leads (SSO/SAML, provider passthrough headers, guardrails, embedded SDK, observability integrations) and confirmed these do not affect the core use case of key pool management and load balancing, where Kinetic Nexus holds its own.

Discussed benchmark targets for the proxy layer: latency overhead, throughput at concurrent load, and key rotation behavior under burst conditions. Confirmed the project is production-ready for the team-key and key-pool use cases without the five gap items.

**Date:** 2026-07-06 · Session 2  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Feature Completeness Review and Rate Limit Architecture Analysis  

**Summary:**  
Opened a dedicated review session to evaluate Kinetic Nexus against enterprise gateway feature requirements. Identified a critical architectural issue: `src/server.ts` was applying a global Fastify rate limit of 200 requests per minute across the entire server instance, which would cap total throughput regardless of how many provider keys were pooled. This was flagged as a structural ceiling that must be addressed before the project can credibly claim key-pool-based throughput scaling. The global limit is correct for abuse protection but must not be confused with per-key or per-team rate limits, which are tracked independently via Redis.

Analyzed the full feature surface — provider cards, RPM/TPM meters, team leaderboard, cost tracking, Analytics charts — against what a team evaluating the project for production use would expect to see. Confirmed the dashboard is competitive for the targeted use case and provided framing for what to communicate in the README.

**Date:** 2026-07-06 · Session 1  
**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase 5c — Analytics Tab, Nexus Tab Rebuild, and Models Tab Rebuild  

**Summary:**  
Executed Phase 5c in full — the largest single session of work on the project to date.

**token.service.ts** was rewritten from the ground up. Added a `resolveRange()` helper that accepts either a named period (`today`, `7d`, `30d`, `90d`) or explicit `customSince`/`customUntil` Date objects, enabling custom date range analytics. Added a `modelCost()` function that handles dual field naming across schema versions (`inputPricePer1k` from the original schema and `inputCostPer1M` from the new dashboard format) using null-coalescing to normalize both. `recordTokenUsage()` was updated to compute `estimatedUsd` at write time by looking up the model registry (cached via Redis with a 60-second TTL), so that all cost data is captured at the moment of usage rather than computed retrospectively. `getUsageSummary()` was extended to return `requests`, `estimatedUsd`, `byProvider`, and per-model input/output splits. Two new export functions were added: `getTimeSeriesByTeam()` returns a day-by-team matrix for multi-series request and token trend charts; `getTimeSeriesByModel()` returns a day-by-model matrix for stacked token breakdowns.

**src/routes/admin.ts** received four new analytics routes: `/admin/analytics/summary`, `/admin/analytics/by-team`, `/admin/analytics/timeseries/teams`, and `/admin/analytics/timeseries/models`. All four accept `from` and `to` query parameters (ISO date strings) that override the `period` parameter when present, enabling custom date range queries from the dashboard. The `90d` period was added to all period union types. Two additional routes were added: `GET /admin/nexus/summary` returning provider pool health counts (active / cooling / banned / total), and `GET /admin/keys/:id/metrics` reading real-time RPM from Redis key `nexus:rpm:{id}`.

**public/index.html** underwent a full rebuild. The Nexus tab was rebuilt to match enterprise-grade quality: a four-stat summary bar (Pools / Active / Cooling / Banned), color-coded provider cards per vendor (orange for Anthropic, blue for Google, purple for Groq, green for OpenAI, yellow for OpenRouter), expandable key tables within each provider card showing individual key status, RPM/TPM utilization progress bars with green/yellow/red threshold coloring (below 60%, 60–85%, above 85%), and a full Add Pool modal with provider-type-aware credential field defaults and a live credential test button. The Models tab was rebuilt to render registry cards with display name, model string, tier badge (Premium/Standard/Fast), status indicator, capability badges (Primary, Fallback, Vision, FIM, Tools), cost per 1M tokens, and context window. An Add/Edit model modal was added with all fields and capability toggles.

The Analytics tab was built from scratch as a Chart.js-powered analytics dashboard. The tab header includes period pills (Today / 7d / 30d / 90d), a custom date range picker (from/to `<input type="date">` fields), and a CSV export button. Five hero metric cards display Requests, Total Tokens, Input Tokens, Output Tokens, and Estimated Cost (in green). Four Chart.js visualizations were implemented: a multi-color line chart of daily request volume by team (`_buildReqChart`), a stacked bar chart of token consumption by model per day (`_buildTokChart`), an area chart of daily cost trend with green fill (`_buildCostChart`), and a horizontal grouped bar chart comparing input versus output tokens per model (`_buildIOChart`). A sortable team leaderboard table with medal icons and columns for tokens, requests, cost, estimated lines of code, and input/output split completes the tab. All Chart.js instances are tracked in a `_charts` object and destroyed before recreation to prevent canvas reuse errors.

Demo mode guards (`if (window._demoMode) return;`) were added to every tab load function — `loadConnect()`, `loadNexus()`, `loadModels()`, `renderTeamKeys()`, `loadSettings()`, and `loadAnalytics()` — to prevent fetch calls to the static server when previewing the dashboard without a backend. A full `_renderDemoAnalytics()` function was added that generates 30 days of realistic random data and renders all four Chart.js charts for demo purposes.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Model Identifier Renamed to `kinetic-nexus-1`  

**Summary:**  
Renamed the catch-all proxy model identifier from `nexus` to `kinetic-nexus-1` across the routing engine, dashboard UI, and documentation references. The legacy `nexus` string was preserved as a silent backward-compatible alias so that any existing configurations continue to route correctly. The rename establishes the canonical model name that is referenced in the README and all public-facing materials going forward.

**Title:** Phase 4 — Team Key Usage Tracking and Leaderboard  

**Summary:**  
Implemented team key attribution throughout the request pipeline. When a request is authenticated with a team key, the key's ID is stamped on the Fastify request object (`request.teamKeyId`) and forwarded to `recordTokenUsage()`, which writes it as a foreign key reference on the `TokenUsage` record. `getUsageByTeamKey()` was added to aggregate usage by team key — returning total tokens, input/output splits, request count, and estimated USD per key — sorted by total token consumption descending. The Usage tab in the dashboard was updated to render a team leaderboard table showing each named key's consumption, request count, cost, and estimated lines of code generated (computed as `Math.round(tokens / 50)`).

**Title:** Demo Mode — Full Dashboard Preview Without a Running Server  

**Summary:**  
Added a demo mode that allows the dashboard to be opened as a static file and display realistic pre-populated content without any backend connection. Demo mode is detected via a `?demo=1` query parameter or a `sessionStorage` flag. When active, all tab load functions return early before attempting any fetch calls, and `enterDemoMode()` populates all tabs with representative static data: mock provider pools with key counts, a sample model registry, example team keys, and realistic usage statistics. This enables the dashboard to be shared, previewed in CI, or demonstrated to evaluators without requiring a live PostgreSQL/Redis stack.

**Title:** Phase 3 — Five-Tab Web Dashboard  

**Summary:**  
Built the complete web dashboard served from `public/index.html`. The dashboard is a single-file vanilla JavaScript application with a persistent sidebar navigation and five tabs: **Connect** (server status, endpoint URL, model name, quick-copy team key generator), **Nexus** (provider pool management), **Models** (model registry), **Team Keys** (scoped access token management), and **Settings** (admin configuration). Each tab uses fetch calls to the admin API endpoints, renders HTML dynamically, and provides inline forms for all management operations. The sidebar uses an active-state indicator and all tabs load lazily on first click. The entire dashboard ships as a single HTML file with no external dependencies beyond the Fastify static file server.

**Title:** Phase 2 — Smart Routing Engine with Tiered Fallback and Live Validation  

**Summary:**  
Rewrote the routing engine with a three-tier fallback system: Premium, Standard, and Fast. Each provider key in the pool is assigned a tier at creation time. On each incoming request, the router selects the highest-tier active key using round-robin selection across keys at that tier. If no key is available at the top tier (all cooling or banned), the router falls back to the next tier automatically. A live validation step runs when keys are added or tested: the system sends a minimal probe request to the provider's API and records the response time. Keys that fail validation are placed in a cooling state and retried on a configurable backoff. The `kinetic-nexus-1` catch-all model was introduced as the single model string that resolves to the best available provider/model combination based on the tier configuration.

**Title:** Phase 1 — Dead Code Removal and Schema Cleanup  

**Summary:**  
Audited the full codebase for dead code, unused imports, unused schema fields, and redundant route handlers. Removed all identified dead paths. Cleaned the Prisma schema — consolidated the provider pool models, ensured foreign key relationships were correct between `NexusProvider`, `NexusKey`, `NexusTeamKey`, and `TokenUsage`, and removed fields that were no longer referenced. The resulting schema is the canonical data model for all subsequent phases.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Phase Plan Finalized — Concurrency, RPM Architecture, and Model Naming Decisions  

**Summary:**  
Continued from the June 30 assessment session. Finalized critical architectural decisions ahead of Phase 1 execution. Confirmed that all incoming requests to the same provider run concurrently — the proxy does not serialize requests through a queue; the RPM limit is enforced via a Redis counter (INCR with 60-second TTL) that blocks individual keys when they exceed their limit, while all other keys in the pool remain fully available. This means pooling ten keys at 20 RPM each yields effectively 200 RPM aggregate throughput, with each key individually rate-limited, not the pool as a whole.

Decided that the model name exposed to users would always be a single fixed string (`nexus`, later renamed `kinetic-nexus-1`) rather than exposing provider-specific model IDs directly. This design choice hides provider implementation details, allows the routing tier to be changed transparently, and gives users one stable model string to configure across all their tools.

Confirmed the Connect tab design: it exposes a single base URL (local or domain-based) and a single model name, making the entire configuration of a client tool a two-field operation.

**Title:** Fix — Auto-Infer Provider from Model Name  

**Summary:**  
Fixed a routing bug where requests specifying a real provider model ID (e.g. `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-1.5-pro`) would fail to route correctly because the provider field was not being inferred from the model string. Added a `resolveProvider()` lookup that inspects the model name prefix and maps it to the correct provider type, so that tools using real model IDs (rather than the `nexus` alias) route to the right provider pool without requiring the caller to specify a provider field explicitly.

**Title:** Initial Release — First Version-Controlled Commit  

**Summary:**  
Made the first organized git commit of the Kinetic Nexus codebase under the tag `feat: initial release`. The committed code represented the foundation of the proxy: a Fastify v5 TypeScript server with a Prisma-managed PostgreSQL schema, Redis-backed RPM and TPM rate limiting via `ioredis`, AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored provider API keys, a multi-provider routing layer supporting Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, and OpenRouter, SHA-256-hashed team key authentication with usage attribution, an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` proxy endpoint with full streaming support via server-sent events, and a basic admin REST API for managing provider pools and keys. This commit established the project as a standalone open-source artifact.

**Author:** Abbas  
**Title:** Open Source Readiness Assessment and Phase Planning  

**Summary:**  
Conducted a full brutally honest evaluation of the existing Kinetic Nexus codebase to determine its readiness for public open-source release. The assessment covered: routing quality and fallback behavior, key pool management completeness, dashboard usability, schema design, competitive positioning relative to existing proxies in the ecosystem, and what a developer encountering the project for the first time would find. The evaluation confirmed the core proxy mechanics were sound but identified that the project needed a focused cleanup pass, a polished dashboard, and a cleaner public API surface before it could stand on its own as an open-source product.

Established the full 6-phase delivery plan: Phase 1 (dead code removal and schema cleanup), Phase 2 (smart routing engine with tiered fallback), Phase 3 (five-tab web dashboard), Phase 4 (team key usage tracking and leaderboard), Phase 5 (Nexus tab parity, Models tab, and Analytics with Chart.js), Phase 6 (integration tests, documentation, and public GitHub launch). Design decisions made in this session: the proxy would always expose a single model name rather than surfacing provider model IDs; the dashboard Connect tab would provide a one-URL-one-key setup experience; the project would be deployable by a single developer on a laptop with one command.
