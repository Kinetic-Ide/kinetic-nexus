# Alayra Nexus — Dashboard Plan (Phase 7)

**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT — this is the single source of truth for Phase 7 ordering.
**Last reconciled:** 2026-07-14 (Session 47) · **Author:** Abbas · **Scope:** the Nexus operator dashboard.

> **Why this file was rewritten.** The original (2026-07-11) plan ended with *"Nothing in this plan has
> been implemented"* and numbered the phases one way; a product re-sequencing on 2026-07-12 numbered
> them another way; and the code went a third way. Three sources drifted. This file now reconciles all
> three and is authoritative. If a phase is not in §3, it is not scheduled.

The `kinetic-admin` app is **reference only** — a source of UX patterns — and is never modified.

## 0. THE BLOCKER: the new dashboard is not being served

**`src/server.ts` serves `frontend/` (the old vanilla dashboard). `Dockerfile` copies `frontend/` into
the runtime image. `web/dist` is never served and never packaged.**

Everything built in P7.1–P7.5 — Overview, the redesigned Nexus, model management, Analytics — is
therefore **invisible in every real deployment**, including the published container. It only appears
when a developer runs the Vite dev server.

**The cutover is blocked by a parity gap, not by laziness.** The old dashboard still owns two things
the new one does not:

| Capability | Old `frontend/` | New `web/` |
|---|---|---|
| Settings (SSRF · guardrails · routing · cache · notifications · compliance · audit viewer) | ✅ working | ❌ placeholder |
| Team keys | ✅ working | ❌ placeholder |
| Models | ✅ own tab | ✅ *better* — folded into Nexus (P7.4b) |
| Overview · Analytics · themes · pool/key/model editing | ❌ none | ✅ shipped |

Flipping the static root today would take working configuration **away** from operators — a real
regression. So the remaining phases are ordered to **close parity, then cut over.** The cutover is the
milestone that makes five phases of work real; nothing after it matters as much.

## 1. What is actually shipped (verified against git, 2026-07-14)

| Phase | What landed | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| **P7.1** | Vite + Preact `web/` app; slate-glass tokens; **dark + light** theme; self-hosted fonts + charts (killed the CDN bug); component kit; app shell + router; 12-section IA | — |
| **P7.2** | **Overview** landing: one `/admin/overview` aggregate, clickable stat cards, four 7-day charts, leaderboards, recent activity | — |
| **P7.3** | **Nexus** (pools/keys/health + honest routing-rules view), **Models**, **Connect** | — |
| **P7.4a** | Chart aliveness (per-metric colour, rich hover), Alayra logo wired, Nexus add-provider/add-key restored | `d5174af` |
| **P7.4b** | **Models folded INTO Nexus** (tab removed); live model discovery (`fetch-models`); per-key RPM/TPM/max-users | `8f05a7f` |
| **P7.4c** | Editable model details: capability-driven per-modality pricing (incl. realtime audio in/out) + bundled pricing catalog + auto-fill | `a102b6d` |
| **P7.4d** | Edit provider / edit key dialogs; **Max Users enforced**; per-provider extra headers (Anthropic `anthropic-version`) | `bd12911` `4ff409b` `5c695e8` |
| **P7.5** | **Analytics**: per-request outcome + latency + **cache-savings recording** (they were never written down), one aggregate endpoint, live Analytics page | `2d604ef` `7ca17db` `ed2c7b8` |

**Sections live in `web/`:** Overview · Nexus · Connect · Analytics · Teams · Security · Caching · Logs · Settings.
**Still placeholders:** Enterprise · Admin.

## 2. Information architecture — 12 sections

**Models is gone** — folded into Nexus in P7.4b, where a pool now owns its own models, keys, limits
and pricing. **Health was added in P7.12** (Abbas's call — server/provider health and future
benchmarks needed a home of their own; route `/status` because `/health` is the liveness probe).

Overview · **Nexus** · Connect · Analytics · Teams · Enterprise · Security · Caching · **Health** ·
Logs · Settings · Admin

---

## 3. Remaining phases — ordered by dependency, not preference

The first three phases exist to **reach parity so the cutover can happen**. Everything in them is
"surface a backend that is already built and tested" — low risk, high visibility.

### ~~P7.6 — Settings (sub-tabs) + Logs~~ ✅ **DONE** (`414baf5`)
Settings is seven sub-tabs (Routing · Cache · Guardrails · Notifications · Network · Compliance ·
Appearance), each loading and saving only what it owns; every control states its consequence. Logs is
its own filterable, read-only section. **No backend change was needed** — every endpoint already
existed. Fixed two bugs found while building: the Toggle was silently dead (a `<label>` around a
`<button>` re-dispatched the click, so every switch fired twice and no-oped), and panels re-seeded
from a prop in an effect, which could clobber an in-progress edit and left "unsaved changes" stuck
forever after a save.

### ~~P7.6b — Dashboard polish + review fixes~~ ✅ **DONE**
A finish pass over what P7.1–P7.6 shipped, no new features. Three visible defects fixed and verified
live in both themes: (1) **charts** rendered blurred and ~2× too tall — the SVG used a fixed
`320×120` viewBox with `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, so the browser stretched it ~1.9×; it now
measures its container and renders 1:1 (a 120px-tall chart measures 120px, was 223px); (2) **table
headers** on right-aligned columns drifted left of their cells — a CSS specificity bug where
`.table thead th` beat `.tRight`, fixed with `.table thead th.tRight`; (3) **dark-theme `<select>`
popups** rendered white with black hover text because the `<option>` had no styling — now themed from
tokens. Plus a review round on the edit dialogs: `PoolModels` remove no longer leaves buttons disabled
(moved to `finally`, edit disabled during removal); `EditKeyDialog` stops treating a typed `0` as
"keep old"; edit dialog Save buttons tied to their form via `form=`; `Modal` uses `aria-labelledby`;
registry id-collision suffix increments. Chart geometry locked by a regression test.

### ~~P7.7 — Security + Caching~~ ✅ **DONE**
**Security:** one home for 2FA/TOTP (enrol via manual secret + otpauth URI — no QR dependency —
confirm, one-time recovery codes, regenerate, disable), admin API tokens (mint owner/viewer,
plaintext-once, revoke), the sign-in policy facts (session TTL / lockout), and a read-only network-egress
summary linking to Settings → Network (one editor, no duplicate). All backend already existed.
**Caching:** the response-cache control **moved here** from Settings (so Settings went 7→6 tabs) and
now sits beside live stats (entries, 7-day hit rate + savings, scoped to a recent window for honesty)
and a one-click purge behind an honest confirm. New backend: `GET /admin/cache/stats` +
`POST /admin/cache/purge` (SCAN + UNLINK, non-blocking; purge is global by design — the namespace is
inside the hashed key), plus `countKeys`/`deleteKeys` in a testable `lib/redisScan.ts`. The pre-existing
`POST /admin/cache/flush` (registry-cache bust) was left untouched for parity.
*Deferred to P7.13:* real viewer role-gating in the new dashboard. Today an owner-only action a viewer
attempts is met with a plain "your session is read-only" message rather than being hidden — consistent
with how the rest of the redesigned console behaves, and cleanly fixed once the accounts primitive lands.

### ~~P7.7c — CodeQL security-scan remediation~~ ✅ **DONE**
Twelve CodeQL alerts from the P7.7 push, triaged against the code into three groups.
**Fixed (7):** per-route rate limits (`lib/routeRateLimits.ts` tiers AUTH/ADMIN_WRITE/ADMIN_READ)
on the sensitive routes — login, TOTP confirm/disable, recovery-codes, SSO login/callback, key
metrics, team-key delete, cache flush — on top of the existing global abuse guard; a test proves the
limit engages (429). **Tightened (1):** the SSRF sink now fetches the validated `URL` object
`assertSafeUrl` returns (the guard already blocked private/metadata/loopback and is tested).
**Bonus:** recovery codes widened 40→64-bit. **Documented false positives (dismissed in GitHub UI):**
sha256 on high-entropy tokens (session/API/team keys) and the constant-time-compare length-equaliser —
bcrypt is the wrong tool there and would break the O(1) lookups; reasoning captured in code comments.
No schema change, nothing on the proxy hot path.

**Follow-up (same day): CodeQL cannot see `@fastify/rate-limit` or the SSRF guard**, so the code fixes
above did not clear the alerts — it re-raised them at shifted line numbers, and manual dismissal is a
treadmill on an actively-edited codebase. Resolved durably by switching CodeQL from default to
**advanced setup** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` + `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`) and filtering
the two rules that only ever false-positive here (`js/missing-rate-limiting`, `js/insufficient-password-hash`),
each with a written justification. Every other query stays active — SSRF (`js/request-forgery`) included,
with its one finding dismissed by design. Requires a one-time GitHub toggle (disable default setup).

### ~~P7.8 — Teams~~ ✅ **DONE** — *the last parity blocker cleared*
Teams are now a first-class console section — the old dashboard only ever had a bare "Team Keys" list;
this is a genuine upgrade. Two sub-tabs: **Teams** (create/edit/delete, with budget cap + period,
status, and per-period spend shown against the cap) and **Access keys** (create, assign to a team,
reassign, copy, revoke). The BYOK fall-back flag is edited on the team form.

The headline fix: **`assignedTier` is wired into routing.** It used to be stored and silently ignored
— a lie. A team's preferred tier now leads the model-first candidate ordering (`selectModels` takes a
`preferredTier`, threaded from the team key through `discoverBestPool` on both the chat and non-chat
paths), then the normal premium→standard→fast failover follows, so a preference never becomes an
outage when that tier is momentarily exhausted. Unit-tested at the ordering layer.

Members + Org are deliberately deferred to P7.13 (they need the same accounts primitive as sub-admins;
build it once).

### ~~P7.9 — CUTOVER~~ ✅ **DONE** 🚩 *the milestone — the redesign now reaches users*
The gateway serves the redesigned dashboard (`web/dist`) instead of the old `frontend/`, which is
deleted. New this phase: a **SPA deep-link fallback** (`lib/spaFallback.ts` + a `setNotFoundHandler`
in `server.ts`) so a refresh or bookmark on a client-side route (`/teams`, `/nexus`, `/admin` …)
serves `index.html` and lets the client router resolve it — while API clients still get an honest
JSON 404. The discriminator is the `Accept` header, not a route list, so it never rots as sections are
added. Static plugin now `wildcard: false`; Vite `base` switched `'./'`→`'/'` so assets resolve from
the root at any route depth. Docker builds `web/` in the build stage and copies only `web/dist` into
the runtime image. Verified: an `inject` integration test drives the real wiring (deep link → app,
API path → JSON 404), and the built deep link serves 200 + absolute assets. **This is the phase that
makes P7.1–P7.8 real.** Small in code, largest in consequence.

### ~~P7.9b — Sign-in screen~~ ✅ **DONE** — *the cutover's missing front door*
The cutover surfaced that the redesigned dashboard never rebuilt the old dashboard's login, so it was
unreachable without a hand-set token. Backend auth (password → session token, TOTP, lockout) has
existed since Phase 6; this added only its screen. `web/src/pages/Login.tsx` (password, on-demand 2FA
code field, plain wrong-password / lockout messages); `App` gates on a session token and seeds it
synchronously so a signed-in reload never flashes login; a global 401 clears the token and fires
`nx:unauthorized` → back to sign-in; the Topbar sign-out is wired. `api.ts` gained `login()` (off the
generic path so a failed sign-in doesn't self-trigger the 401 handler) and `clearToken()`. Full basic
identity (sub-admins, first-run, recovery-key, device fingerprint) is still P7.13; this is just the
front door so the product is usable.

### ~~P7.10 — Budgeting cascade + Teams restructure~~ ✅ **DONE**
Teams became **three sub-tabs**: **Overview** (the team list + totals), **Access keys** (the global
key view, now filterable by team and free-text search), and **Team stats** — the new one. Team stats
is a team selector (dropdown + search) and a period filter (today/7d/30d/90d) over a new read,
`GET /admin/teams/:id/stats` (`services/teamStats.service.ts`): spend/requests/success-rate/tokens for
the viewing window, cost + request trends, busiest models (reusing Analytics' `ByModel`), and the
**per-member breakdown** — one row per access key, click to expand into spend, share of team,
requests, tokens, cost/request and last-active. A **"member" is honestly a team's access key**: the
gateway has no user identity, so a key *is* the seat, and an idle key is listed with zeros rather than
dropped. **Share is a proportion, never an allocation** — the cap lives on the team and no per-member
cap exists to report. Two windows coexist and are labelled: the period tabs pick the *viewing* window,
while the budget card reports the team's *own* daily/weekly/monthly cycle, read exactly the way
admission reads it — blurring them would show a 7-day spend against a monthly cap.

The cascade's enforceable half: **`Team.overBudgetAction`** (migration `0013`, additive, default
`'block'` = the historical behaviour, so no existing team changed). `block` = today's hard 429;
`notify` = a soft cap that alerts but never blocks; `downgrade` = keep serving but pin routing to the
fast/cheapest tier. Threaded through `checkTeamBudget` (which now returns `downgrade` alongside
`allowed`) into **both** admission paths, where an over-budget downgraded team routes to `fast`
regardless of its `assignedTier`. Unit-tested at the verdict layer and proven on the dispatch path
(over-budget → served, not blocked, with `discoverBestPool` called with `fast`).

*Deliberately not built, because the schema cannot back it honestly (see §5):* an **org-level or
pool-level budget parent** (no `Org` model exists, and pools are shared infrastructure, not spend
owners), a **true per-tier % split** of one budget (needs two caps per team), **per-team email
recipients** (notification config is global), and **quarterly/annual** windows. Listed in the backlog
rather than faked.

### ~~P7.11 — Notifications bell + Branding~~ ✅ **DONE**
**The finding that shaped the phase:** all five alert types were gated *at their call sites* by
`notificationsArmed(event)` = `config.enabled && config.events[event]` — and `enabled` is **false by
default**. So on a default install the alert message was never even built, and alerts were
fire-and-forget email/webhook with no persistence at all. A bell wired to the old `notify()` would
have been permanently empty: a placeholder pretending to be a feature.

**So recording was split from delivery.** Every raised alert is now recorded in the feed
*regardless* of the email config (migration `0014`, new `Notification` table); `enabled` and the
per-event flags now gate only whether an alert *also leaves the building*. `notify()` records first,
then decides on delivery; the four call sites no longer short-circuit. Delivery behaviour, coalescing
and the release-on-failed-send are untouched — their tests pass unchanged. The feed takes its **own**
Redis claim key (`nexus:notify:feed:`), separate from the send guard (`nexus:notify:sent:`), because
the send path *releases* its claim on a failed delivery to allow a retry — sharing one key would
re-insert an entry already sitting in the bell. This reframes Settings → Notifications as *email*
settings, which lines up with the deferred note #2 below (that UI reorg is still deferred).

**The bell** (`shell/NotificationsBell.tsx`) is a real dropdown: unread badge (counted over *all*
unread, never just the page shown), entries with relative time, mark-one / mark-all read, close on
outside-click or Escape, and a 60s poll (a socket would be overkill — alerts are coalesced to one per
window per source). Selecting an alert marks it read and **jumps to the section that raised it** via
a pure `sectionFor()` map in `lib/notify.ts` (keyBanned/breakerOpened/tierExhausted → Nexus,
adminLockout → Security, budgetThreshold → Teams) — an alert saying a key died is only useful if it
lands you where you can replace it.

**Branding** — company name + logo in the sidebar and on the sign-in screen. **No schema**: it is one
small singleton blob, which is what `AppSettings` is for. The logo is stored as a **data URI**, never
a URL: this gateway self-hosts its assets (the Chart.js CDN was removed for exactly this reason), and
a remote logo would break air-gapped/strict-CSP deployments *and* leak a request to a third party on
every load of a public sign-in page. Validation is pure and tested (`lib/branding.ts`): PNG/JPEG/WEBP/SVG
only, ≤64KB, and a stored value that no longer validates is dropped rather than served. SVG is safe
because the logo is only ever rendered through an `<img src=…>` (browsers treat that as secure static
mode) — it must never be inlined into the DOM. The read is a **public `GET /branding`** (the login
screen has no session yet; a branded login page is public by definition); the write is
`PUT /admin/branding`, owner-only and audited. A white-labelled sidebar keeps "Alayra Nexus" on the
line beneath, so the console still says what it is.

**Enhancements taken in this phase:** (1) **notification retention** — the feed is pruned by the
existing `runRetention()` job via a new `notificationRetentionDays` (default **30**, editable in
Settings → Compliance, `0` = forever). Alerts are operational noise, not a record — the audit trail
testifies to what happened — so they default shorter than the 90-day audit/usage windows, and this is
the one growing table that would otherwise have had no ceiling. (2) Mark-all-read + unread-only
filtering. **Caught in live verification:** saving branding left the sidebar showing the old name
until a page reload, because each reader holds its own fetch — fixed with a `nx:branding` event that
every `useBranding` listens for (the same idiom the session gate already uses for `nx:unauthorized`),
and pinned by a regression test. Dead code removed: `notificationsArmed` had no callers left.

### ~~P7.12 — Health section (Server health + the new Health IA home)~~ ✅ **DONE**
**Abbas's IA call, adopted:** health metrics had no home in the 11-section IA — the phase said *what*
but never *where*. There is now a **Health section** (12th section, after Caching) with three tabs:
**Server** (the real P7.12), **Providers** (read-only capacity summary reusing `getNexusOverview`,
linking to Nexus — one editor, no duplicate, same rule as Security→Network), and **Benchmarks**
(honestly empty until built; it says what it will do rather than showing invented numbers).
**Route is `/status`, NOT `/health`** — `GET /health` is the liveness probe, a JSON route the SPA
fallback deliberately excludes, so a deep link to /health would render `{ok:true}` instead of the page.

**The audit finding fixed:** `/health` was a hardcoded `{ok:true}` that never checked anything — a
load balancer would call the gateway healthy with its database down. Two probes now, each answering
the question it is actually for: `/health` stays a cheap liveness ping (restarting cannot fix a dead
database; a liveness probe that checks dependencies turns every DB blip into a restart loop), and the
new **`GET /ready`** really probes Redis + Postgres and answers **503** with per-check detail when a
dependency is down. Degraded-but-answering still says ready — pulling a slow gateway out of rotation
turns a slowdown into an outage. Both exempt from the abuse rate limit.

**What makes it real, not decoration:** a new in-memory **health sampler**
(`services/healthSampler.service.ts` over the pure `lib/health.ts`) probes Redis (PING) and Postgres
(SELECT 1) every 15s, reads the event-loop delay histogram (`monitorEventLoopDelay`, reset per tick)
and process CPU/RSS/heap, and keeps **one hour in a ring buffer** (240 samples, a few KB). That
buffer feeds the latency **sparklines**, the **p50/p95/p99 chips**, and the **per-minute status
strip** (worst sample per minute; empty minutes render as grey gaps, and a fresh process says
"collecting — N of 240 samples" instead of faking continuity). Redis detail parses `INFO`
(memory/maxmemory, clients, ops/sec, hit rate, evictions, fragmentation); Postgres detail reads
`pg_stat_activity`/`pg_stat_database`/`pg_database_size`/largest tables — every query independently
guarded so a managed instance that refuses one view nulls that fact instead of blanking the panel.

**Honesty rules baked in (keep them):** no Postgres "disk free" anywhere (unknowable from SQL); no
Redis memory % when `maxmemory` is unset (no ceiling exists — prose instead of a gauge); the
container memory gauge reads the **cgroup limit** (v2 then v1), NEVER `os.totalmem()` (inside Docker
that is the HOST's RAM); heap gauge is against the V8 heap limit; a failed probe is a **null** point
that breaks the sparkline rather than drawing a reassuring zero; hit rates with no traffic are "—",
not 100%. Every status carries its word (Healthy/Degraded/Down, Pass/Slow/Fail) — never colour alone.
The **readiness checks table is `/ready` rendered** — measured vs threshold vs verdict — so ops and
the dashboard share one truth. `GET /admin/health/overview` (admin-guarded) is the page's single read.

### P7.13 — Admin (multi-user) + first-run identity
Sub-admins, role-based viewer users, invites; first-run key generation (hashed) + admin identity
(name/email/password/TOTP) + device fingerprint + recovery key + the double-confirmed reset-wipe.
The largest backend item; deliberately last, once the shell exists to present it.

### Backlog (unscheduled — pull in when they earn it)
- **Team stats: Comparison mode** *(Abbas, 2026-07-16)* — a "Compare" button in Team stats to select
  2 teams or 2 members and show them side-by-side / overlaid. Deferred by agreement as a future
  enhancement once the base Team stats tab is in use; the stats endpoint already returns everything a
  comparison needs, so this is a UI-only addition (two fetches, one layout).
- **Budget cascade — the levels the schema cannot back yet** *(from P7.10)*: an **Org/pool budget
  parent** (blocked on the missing `Org` model — pools are shared infrastructure, so a pool budget
  would need a new owner concept), a **per-tier % split** of a team's budget (needs two caps per team
  and a per-tier spend counter), **per-team email recipients** (notification config is global today),
  and **quarterly/annual** budget windows (the counter TTLs and `periodKey` assume ≤ monthly).
- **Benchmarks + branded PDF** — run tests on demand, clean report, downloadable. Its home now
  exists: the Health → Benchmarks tab (P7.12), which states this plan and stays honestly empty
  until the feature is real.
- **First-class provider presets** — xAI, Azure, Bedrock, Vertex, HuggingFace, Together. They work
  **today** only via the generic `custom` OpenAI-compatible path (baseUrl + auth + modelIdPath); there
  are no presets. Purely a convenience layer.
- **Enterprise/Org section** — no `Org` model exists (`Team` was shaped to take an `orgId` later).
- **Per-team analytics** — the Analytics aggregate is global; a team filter is a small extension.

---

## Further changes notes (post-completion polish — DEFER until every phase is done)

> Captured 2026-07-16 from Abbas's first real click-through of the live product (Docker). These are
> **cosmetic/UX refinements, not functional gaps** — the decision is to finish all functional phases
> first, then return to these so we ship a complete product before polishing. Do NOT action these mid-phase.

1. **Content does not fill the width — too much empty space on every tab.** The main content column is
   effectively capped/narrow, so pages (Overview especially) leave a large blank area on the right and
   look under-filled on a wide screen. Audit the page/shell max-width and padding; let content breathe
   into the full width (or introduce a sensible max with better use of the space — e.g. more columns).
   Applies to **all tabs**, so it is a shell/layout fix, not a per-page one.
2. **Notifications tab is cluttered — split it up.** (a) Give **Email** its own sub-tab (Resend API
   key + From address + recipients), separate from the event list. (b) The events section should sit
   under a single master **"Enable email notifications"** toggle; when off, the whole event list is
   disabled/hidden. Right now the master "Send alerts" switch and the per-event switches read as one
   undifferentiated cluster. Reorganise into: master toggle → (when on) event checklist + Email config
   in its own tab.
3. **"Add provider pool" dialog — clarity, not new fields.** Users don't know what SLUG / Auth header /
   Auth prefix / Model ID path / Extra headers mean. Add short inline hints on each (one line each,
   like the "url-safe id" hint already on SLUG). **Also make it discoverable that model *capabilities*
   (chat/embedding/image/…) are chosen on the *models inside a pool*, not on the pool** — e.g. a note in
   the dialog ("you'll pick each model's capabilities after creating the pool") and/or a prompt to add a
   model right after a pool is created. This is a known-correct design (pool = credentials; model =
   capabilities/tier/pricing) that simply isn't obvious in the UI.

---

## 4. Standing decisions (do not re-litigate)

1. **Rendering: Vite + Preact → static build.** Fastify keeps serving static files; single-container
   deployment unchanged. *(2026-07-11)*
2. **First-run reset = full database wipe.** Loud, double-confirmed, documented. An attacker who knows
   the trick gains nothing. *(2026-07-11)*
3. **Teams before Budgeting.** A budget cascade needs teams that exist in the UI. *(2026-07-14)*
4. **Parity before cutover.** Never remove working operator capability to ship a prettier shell.
   *(2026-07-14)*
5. **Models stays folded into Nexus.** A pool owns its models, keys, limits and pricing. *(P7.4b)*
6. **`kinetic-admin` is reference only.** Never modified.

## 5. Known lies in the product to fix as we pass them

- ~~**`Team.assignedTier` is stored and silently ignored by routing.**~~ ✅ Fixed in P7.8 — it now
  biases the model-first candidate ordering (preferred tier first, normal failover after).
- **No `Org` model.** The Enterprise section cannot be honest until one exists or the scope shrinks.

---

*Every phase ends with the standing green gate — lint / typecheck / test / build / audit all clean on
**both** the gateway and the dashboard — plus a `nexus-changes.md` entry, a commit, and a push.*
