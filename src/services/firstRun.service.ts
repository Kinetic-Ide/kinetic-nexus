// ── First run: claiming the gateway (Phase 7.13a) ─────────────────────────────
//
// A gateway with accounts has a bootstrap problem: somebody has to become the first owner, and
// until they do there is no account to authorise creating one. Whoever reaches an unclaimed
// gateway first would otherwise own it — the land-grab that anyone who can route to the port wins.
//
// ADMIN_PASSWORD is the answer, and this is its new job. It is in the deployer's .env and nowhere
// else, so it is proof of the one thing that matters here: you are the person who installed this.
// It is a CLAIM TICKET, not a credential — spent once, and refused as a sign-in forever after (see
// adminAuth.service). Whoever controls the environment controls the box anyway, so gating on it
// gives away nothing that was not already theirs.
