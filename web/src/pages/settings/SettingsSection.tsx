// Every settings panel is the same shape: load a config, edit it, save it, and be told plainly
// whether that worked. That shape lives here once — loading, failure-with-retry, the save bar, the
// error, and the confirmation — so the six panels only describe their own fields.
//
// A panel seeds its fields from `data` once, when it mounts, and never re-seeds itself. Two reasons:
//
//  1. A panel that re-seeds from a prop in an effect can stamp the server's value back over an edit
//     the operator has already made — the effect runs after mount, which on a slow config load can
//     land *after* the first click and silently undo it.
//  2. After a save, the gateway returns what it actually stored. That, not the stale load, is the
//     new truth — and until the form is re-seeded from it, the panel would go on claiming
//     "unsaved changes" forever.
//
// So: this component owns the current truth, and on a successful save it swaps in the server's
// response and bumps `version`, which remounts the panel so its fields re-seed from it. One rule,
// no effects, no races.

 * The footer every panel ends with: the save action, and an honest word about what just happened.

 * sentence instead of a button: the server would refuse anyway, and a control that can only fail
 * is a trap, not a feature. The fields above stay visible — reading the configuration is every
